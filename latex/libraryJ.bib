abstract = {Summary In the face of infectious disease, organisms evolved a range of defense mechanisms, with a clear distinction between those that are constitutive (always active) and those that are inducible (elicited by parasites) [1]. Both defense strategies have evolved from each other [2], but we lack an understanding of the conditions that favor one strategy over the other. While it is hard to generalize about their degree of protection, it is possible to make generalizations about their associated fitness costs, which are commonly detected [3-5]. By definition, constitutive defenses are always "on," and are therefore associated with a fixed cost, independent of parasite exposure [4, 5]. Inducible defenses, on the other hand, may lack costs in the absence of parasites but become costly when defense is elicited [6] through processes such as immunopathology [7]. Bacteria can evolve constitutive defense against phage by modification/masking of surface receptors [8, 9], which is often associated with reduced fitness in the absence of phage [10]. Bacteria can also evolve inducible defense using the CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat, CRISPR associated) immune system [11], which is typically elicited upon infection [12-14]. CRISPR-Cas functions by integrating phage sequences into CRISPR loci on the host genome [15]. Upon re-infection, CRISPR transcripts guide cleavage of phage genomes [16-20]. In nature, both mechanisms are important [21, 22]. Using a general theoretical model and experimental evolution, we tease apart the mechanism that drives their evolution and show that infection risk determines the relative investment in the two arms of defense.},

abstract = {Bayesian inference typically requires the computation of an approximation to the posterior distribution. An important requirement for an approximate Bayesian inference algorithm is to output high-accuracy posterior mean and uncertainty estimates. Classical Monte Carlo methods, particularly Markov Chain Monte Carlo, remain the gold standard for approximate Bayesian inference because they have a robust finite-sample theory and reliable convergence diagnostics. However, alternative methods, which are more scalable or apply to problems where Markov Chain Monte Carlo cannot be used, lack the same finite-data approximation theory and tools for evaluating their accuracy. In this work, we develop a flexible new approach to bounding the error of mean and uncertainty estimates of scalable inference algorithms. Our strategy is to control the estimation errors in terms of Wasserstein distance, then bound the Wasserstein distance via a generalized notion of Fisher distance. Unlike computing the Wasserstein distance, which requires access to the normalized posterior distribution, the Fisher distance is tractable to compute because it requires access only to the gradient of the log posterior density. We demonstrate the usefulness of our Fisher distance approach by deriving bounds on the Wasserstein error of the Laplace approximation and Hilbert coresets. We anticipate that our approach will be applicable to many other approximate inference methods such as the integrated Laplace approximation, variational inference, and approximate Bayesian computation},

We developed cheese rinds as model microbial communities by characterizing in situ patterns of diversity and by developing an in vitro system for community reconstruction. Sequencing of 137 different rind communities across 10 countries revealed 24 widely distributed and culturable genera of bacteria and fungi as dominant community members. Reproducible community types formed independent of geographic location of production. Intensive temporal sampling demonstrated that assembly of these communities is highly reproducible. Patterns of community composition and succession observed in situ can be recapitulated in a simple in vitro system. Widespread positive and negative interactions were identified between bacterial and fungal community members. Cheese rind microbial communities represent an experimentally tractable system for defining mechanisms that influence microbial community assembly and function.

In models having shared and exclusive resources, the one or two stable nodes of simpler models may no longer occur in the first quadrant. Such models can simulate how one species by consuming enough overlapping resource can cause another species, unable to maintain itself on its exclusive resources, to go extinct. In models for interspecific interference competition (resource competition purely intraspecific), one or even two more intersections of the zero-isoclines may occur, or the isoclines may intersect once, but with different relative slopes than in the simpler models. 3. 3.

abstract = {A mutant gene which appeared in a finite population will eventually either be lost from the population or fixed (established) in it. The mean time until either of these alternative events takes place was studied by WATTERSON (1962) and EWENS (1963). They made use of a method previously announced by DARL- ING and SIEGERT (1953), and, independently by FELLER (1954). Actually, DARL- ING and SIEGERT refer to its application to genetics. From the standpoint of population genetics, however, it is much more desirable to determine separately the mean time until fixation and that until loss. Since the gene substitution in a population plays a key role in the evolution of the species, it may be of particular interest to know the mean time for a rare mutant gene to become fixed in a finite population, excluding the cases in which such a gene is lost from the population. In the present paper, a solution to this problem will be presented together with Monte Carlo experiments to test some of the theoretical results. Throughout this paper, the senior author (M.

Numerous theoretical models have shown that competing species can coexist if ecological processes such as dispersal, movement, and interaction occur over small spatial scales. In particular, this may be the case for non-transitive communities, that is, those without strict competitive hierarchies. The classic non-transitive system involves a community of three competing species satisfying a relationship similar to the children's game rock-paper-scissors, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Such relationships have been demonstrated in several natural systems. Some models predict that local interaction and dispersal are sufficient to ensure coexistence of all three species in such a community, whereas diversity is lost when ecological processes occur over larger scales. Here, we test these predictions empirically using a non-transitive model community containing three populations of Escherichia coli. We find that diversity is rapidly lost in our experimental community when dispersal and interaction occur over relatively large spatial scales, whereas all populations coexist when ecological processes are localized.},

abstract = {Chemotactic bacteria rely on local concentration gradients to guide them towards the source of a nutrient. Such local cues pointing towards the location of the source are not always available at macroscopic scales because mixing in a flowing medium breaks up regions of high concentration into random and disconnected patches. Thus, animals sensing odours in air or water detect them only intermittently as patches sweep by on the wind or currents. A macroscopic searcher must devise a strategy of movement based on sporadic cues and partial information. Here we propose a search algorithm, which we call 'infotaxis', designed to work under such conditions. Any search process can be thought of as acquisition of information on source location; for infotaxis, information plays a role similar to concentration in chemotaxis. The infotaxis strategy locally maximizes the expected rate of information gain. We demonstrate its efficiency using a computational model of odour plume propagation and experimental data on mixing flows. Infotactic trajectories feature 'zigzagging' and 'casting' paths similar to those observed in the flight of moths. The proposed search algorithm is relevant to the design of olfactory robots, but the general idea of infotaxis can be applied more broadly in the context of searching with sparse information.},

We show that these random fluctuations carry within them valuable information about the underlying genetic network. Far from being a nuisance, the ever-present cellular noise acts as a rich source of excitation that, when processed through a gene network, carries its distinctive fingerprint that encodes a wealth of information about that network. We show that in some cases the analysis of these random fluctuations enables the full identification of network parameters, including those that may otherwise be difficult to measure. This establishes a potentially powerful approach for the identification of gene networks and offers a new window into the workings of these networks.},

abstract = {Experimental determinations of Drosophila population dynamics cannot be explained by the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition. This paper presents other possible mathematical models of competition between species, and gives the results of experiments designed to test the validity of such models. Eight of the ten new models presented contain the Lotka-Volterra model as a special case. The experiments made to test the models are of two kinds. Type 1 experiments are continuous one- or two-species populations, which permit the estimation of the carrying capacity of each species and the numbers of the two species at the point of stable equilibrium. Type 2 experiments measure the change in numbers over a short time interval in populations started with many different initial densities of the two species. Type 2 experiments give information on the dynamics of the two-species system in the phase plane whose coordinates are the number of individuals of each species. The models accounting best for the results are models five and seven (Table II). Each of these two models contains one parameter more than the Lotka-Volterra model. Model five adds a nonlinear term of self-interaction (−{\$}\beta{\$}iN2i). Model seven has the form, dNi/dt = riN/K{\$}\theta{\$}ii(K{\$}\theta{\$}ii − N{\$}\theta{\$}i i − {\$}\alpha{\$}ijNj1−{\$}\theta{\$}i i). The exponential parameter {\$}\theta{\$} removes the restriction of the logistic theory of population growth, that each individual added to the population decrease the rate of growth of the population by a constant amount. With model seven the rate of growth of a population of a single species need not have its maximum at K2, that is when the number of individuals is half the carrying capacity of the environment.},

Recent advances in quantitative experimental techniques, in particular intracellular labeling and multi-channel flow cytometry, allow one to measure the population structure of proliferating and dying lymphocytes for several generations with high precision. These new experimental techniques require novel quantitative methods of analysis. We review several recent mathematical approaches used to describe and analyze cell proliferation data. Using a rigorous mathematical framework, we show that two commonly used models that are based on the theories of age-structured cell populations and of branching processes, are mathematically identical. We provide several simple analytical solutions for a model in which the distribution of inter-division times follows a gamma distribution and show that this model can fit both simulated and experimental data. We also show that the estimates of some critical kinetic parameters, such as the average inter-division time, obtained by fitting models to data may depend on the assumed distribution of inter-division times, highlighting the challenges in quantitative understanding of cell kinetics.},

abstract = {We propose a computational and theoretical framework for analyzing rapid coevolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage and bacteria in their ecological context. Bacteriophage enter host cells via membrane-bound surface receptors often responsible for nutrient uptake. As such, a selective pressure will exist for the bacteria to modify its receptor configuration and, in turn, for the phage to modify its tail fiber. A mathematical model of these trait adaptations is developed by using the framework of adaptive dynamics. Host strains differ in their efficiency of resource uptake and resistance to phage, whereas phage strains differ in their host preference for adsorption. We solve the evolutionary ecology model and find the conditions for coevolutionary branching and relevant dimensionless parameters leading to distinct quasispecies. We confirm these calculations using stochastic Monte Carlo simulations of populations evolving in a chemostat with fixed washout rate and inflow resource density. We find that multiple quasispecies of bacteria and phage can coexist in a homogeneous medium with a single resource. When diversification occurs, quasispecies of phage adsorb effectively to only a limited subset of the total number of quasispecies of bacteria, i.e., functional differences between quasispecies arise endogenously within the evolutionary ecology framework. Finally, we discuss means to relate predictions of this model to experimental studies in the chemostat, using the model organisms Escherichia coli and the virulent strain of lambda phage.},

The coefficient of variation in the extinction time V is found to have a maximum value when the death and birth rates are close in value. For large habitat size K we find that Vmax is of order K1/4 / M1/2, which is much larger than unity so long as M is small compared to K1/2. We also present a study of the SLP using the moment closure approximation (MCA), and discuss the successes and failures of this method. Regarding the former, the MCA yields a steady-state distribution for the population when the death rate is low. Although not correct for the SLP model, the first three moments of this distribution coincide with those calculated exactly for an adjusted SLP in which extinction is forbidden. These exact calculations also pinpoint the breakdown of the MCA as the death rate is increased.},

abstract = {Probability reigns in biology, with random molecular events dictating the fate of individual organisms, and propelling populations of species through evolution. In principle, the master probability equation provides the most complete model of probabilistic behavior in biomolecular networks. In practice, master equations describing complex reaction networks have remained unsolved for over 70 years. This practical challenge is a reason why master equations, for all their potential, have not inspired biological discovery. Herein, we present a closure scheme that solves the master probability equation of networks of chemical or biochemical reactions. We cast the master equation in terms of ordinary differential equations that describe the time evolution of probability distribution moments. We postulate that a finite number of moments capture all of the necessary information, and compute the probability distribution and higher-order moments by maximizing the information entropy of the system. An accurate order closure is selected, and the dynamic evolution of molecular populations is simulated. Comparison with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, which merely sample the probability distribution, demonstrates this closure scheme is accurate for several small reaction networks. The importance of this result notwithstanding, a most striking finding is that the steady state of stochastic reaction networks can now be readily computed in a single-step calculation, without the need to simulate the evolution of the probability distribution in time.},

abstract = {HIV type 1 (HIV-1) can rapidly escape from neutralizing antibody responses. The genetic basis of this escape in vivo is poorly understood. We compared the pattern of evolution of the HIV-1 env gene between individuals with recent HIV infection whose virus exhibited either a low or a high rate of escape from neutralizing antibody responses. We demonstrate that the rate of viral escape at a phenotypic level is highly variable among individuals, and is strongly correlated with the rate of amino acid substitutions. We show that dramatic escape from neutralizing antibodies can occur in the relative absence of changes in glycosylation or insertions and deletions ("indels") in the envelope; conversely, changes in glycosylation and indels occur even in the absence of neutralizing antibody responses. Comparison of our data with the predictions of a mathematical model support a mechanism in which escape from neutralizing antibodies occurs via many amino acid substitutions, with low cross-neutralization between closely related viral strains. Our results suggest that autologous neutralizing antibody responses may play a pivotal role in the diversification of HIV-1 envelope during the early stages of infection.},

For very seldom observed events, such as the collision probability between two aircraft in airspace, these approaches do not lead to accurate results. Indeed, the number of available samples is often insufficient to estimate such low probabilities (at least 106 samples are needed to estimate a probability of order 10-4 with 10{\%} relative error with Monte-Carlo simulations). In this article, one reviewed different appropriate techniques to estimate rare event probabilities that require a fewer number of samples. These methods can be divided into four main categories: parameterization techniques of probability density function tails, simulation techniques such as importance sampling or importance splitting, geometric methods to approximate input failure space and finally, surrogate modeling. Each technique is detailed, its advantages and drawbacks are described and a synthesis that aims at giving some clues to the following question is given: “which technique to use for which problem?”.},

Under most parameter conditions one fixed equilibrium point will be globally stable. Under very rare conditions, a boundary species subset may exist at a set of neutrally stable equilibrium points. When interspecific interference and/or mutualism are also present the above results may not hold, unless these interactions are directed and balanced in a very precise fashion.

abstract = {During initial dental plaque formation, the ability of a species to grow when others cannot would be advantageous, and enhanced growth through interspecies and intergeneric cooperation could be critical. These characteristics were investigated in three coaggregating early colonizers of the tooth surface (Streptococcus gordonii DL1, Streptococcus oralis 34, and Actinomyces naeslundii T14V). Area coverage and cell cluster size measurements showed that attachment of A. naeslundii and of S. gordonii to glass flowcells was enhanced by a salivary conditioning film, whereas attachment of S. oralis was hindered. Growth experiments using saliva as the sole carbon and nitrogen source showed that A. naeslundii was unable to grow either in planktonic culture or as a biofilm, whereas S. gordonii grew under both conditions. S. oralis grew planktonically, but to a much lower maximum cell density than did S. gordonii; S. oralis did not grow reproducibly as a biofilm. Thus, only S. gordonii possessed all traits advantageous for growth as a solitary and independent resident of the tooth. Two-species biofilm experiments analyzed by laser confocal microscopy showed that neither S. oralis nor A. naeslundii grew when coaggregated pairwise with S. gordonii. However, both S. oralis and A. naeslundii showed luxuriant, interdigitated growth when paired together in coaggregated microcolonies. Thus, the S. oralis-A. naeslundii pair formed a mutualistic relationship, potentially contact dependent, that allows each to grow where neither could survive alone. S. gordonii, in contrast, neither was hindered by nor benefited from the presence of either of the other strains. The formation of mutually beneficial interactions within the developing biofilm may be essential for certain initial colonizers to be retained during early plaque development, whereas other initial colonizers may be unaffected by neighboring cells on the substratum.},

abstract = {Evolution is typically thought to proceed through divergence of genes, proteins and ultimately phenotypes. However, similar traits might also evolve convergently in unrelated taxa owing to similar selection pressures. Adaptive phenotypic convergence is widespread in nature, and recent results from several genes have suggested that this phenomenon is powerful enough to also drive recurrent evolution at the sequence level. Where homoplasious substitutions do occur these have long been considered the result of neutral processes. However, recent studies have demonstrated that adaptive convergent sequence evolution can be detected in vertebrates using statistical methods that model parallel evolution, although the extent to which sequence convergence between genera occurs across genomes is unknown. Here we analyse genomic sequence data in mammals that have independently evolved echolocation and show that convergence is not a rare process restricted to several loci but is instead widespread, continuously distributed and commonly driven by natural selection acting on a small number of sites per locus. Systematic analyses of convergent sequence evolution in 805,053 amino acids within 2,326 orthologous coding gene sequences compared across 22 mammals (including four newly sequenced bat genomes) revealed signatures consistent with convergence in nearly 200 loci. Strong and significant support for convergence among bats and the bottlenose dolphin was seen in numerous genes linked to hearing or deafness, consistent with an involvement in echolocation. Unexpectedly, we also found convergence in many genes linked to vision: the convergent signal of many sensory genes was robustly correlated with the strength of natural selection. This first attempt to detect genome-wide convergent sequence evolution across divergent taxa reveals the phenomenon to be much more pervasive than previously recognized.},

abstract = {Competition and predation are the most heavily investigated species interactions in ecology, dominating studies of species diversity maintenance. However, these two interactions are most commonly viewed highly asymmetrically. Competition for resources is seen as the primary interaction limiting diversity, with predation modifying what competition does, although theoretical models have long supported diverse views. Here we show, using a comprehensive three-trophic-level model, that competition and predation should be viewed symmetrically: these two interactions are equally able to either limit or promote diversity. Diversity maintenance requires within-species density feedback loops to be stronger than between-species feedback loops. We quantify the contributions of predation and competition to these loops in a simple, interpretable form, showing their equivalent potential to strengthen or weaken diversity maintenance. Moreover, we show that competition and predation can undermine each other, with the tendency of the stronger interaction to promote or limit diversity prevailing. The past failure to appreciate the symmetrical effects and interactions of competition and predation has unduly restricted diversity maintenance studies. A multitrophic perspective should be adopted to examine a greater variety of possible effects of predation than generally considered in the past. Conservation and management strategies need to be much more concerned with the implications of changes in the strengths of trophic interactions.},

both Resources and Predators are assumed to have some logistic growth when the focal species are absent

niche overlap is determined by R and P, and has limiting values when either of those is set to zero; thus niche overlap is determined by R when r{\_}R is small (resources regenerate slowly) and set by P when r'-P is small (predators depend primarily on focal species, less on external prey)

Phenotypic variation can be plastic or heritable and both mechanisms can drive phenotypic change at rates comparable to or faster than those of ecological dynamics (e.g. changes in population abundances or spatial distributions). In this study, we compare the effects rapidly induced and rapidly evolving defences have on community dynamics by considering the fast phenotypic change limit using fast-slow systems theory. Our approach allows us to study phenotypically plastic and evolving systems with one overarching theory, thus capturing the effects rapidly induced defences have on ecological dynamics and how those effects differ from the effects of evolving defences. Our results show that rapidly induced defences tend to stabilize community dynamics and that some behaviours observed in rapidly evolving systems cannot be produced by phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract = {Recognition of antigens by the adaptive immune system relies on a highly diverse T cell receptor repertoire. The mechanism that maintains this diversity is based on competition for survival stimuli; these stimuli depend upon weak recognition of self-antigens by the T cell antigen receptor. We study the dynamics of diversity maintenance as a stochastic competition process between a pair of T cell clonotypes that are similar in terms of the self-antigens they recognise. We formulate a bivariate continuous-time Markov process for the numbers of T cells belonging to the two clonotypes. We prove that the ultimate fate of both clonotypes is extinction and provide a bound on mean extinction times. We focus on the case where the two clonotypes exhibit negligible competition with other T cell clonotypes in the repertoire, since this case provides an upper bound on the mean extinction times. As the two clonotypes become more similar in terms of the self-antigens they recognise, one clonotype quickly becomes extinct in a process resembling classical competitive exclusion. We study the limiting probability distribution for the bivariate process, conditioned on non-extinction of both clonotypes. Finally, we derive deterministic equations for the number of cells belonging to each clonotype as well as a linear Fokker-Planck equation for the fluctuations about the deterministic stable steady state. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The sources of this variation are not entirely understood and can be very difficult to determine. In this manuscript, we demonstrate experimentally how randomness in bacterial colonization can result in large differences in the composition of host-associated bacterial communities, using the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a tractable host model. We find that the amount of variation between individual communities is a function of two rates relevant to how bacteria colonize the host intestine: the colonization rate and the birth rate. We can manipulate the degree of variation between communities by altering the colonization rate, using the amount of bacteria presented to the worms to control the rate at which migrants enter the intestine. When worms are fed with two neutrally competing, fluorescently labeled bacterial strains at low colonization rates, we are able to produce noise-induced bistability in this system, in which each community is dominated by bacteria of only one color. These results demonstrate the potential importance of noise and randomness as a driver of variation between communities and highlight the utility of the simple model organism C. elegans for studying questions relevant to host-associated microbial communities.},

Yet this diversity in primary sex-determining signals is coupled with conserved molecular pathways that trigger male or female development. Conflicting selection on different parts of the genome and on the two sexes may drive many of these transitions, but few systems with rapid turnover of sex determination mechanisms have been rigorously studied.

A well-adapted repertoire should be tuned to the pathogenic environment to reduce the cost of infections. We develop a general framework for predicting the optimal repertoire that minimizes the cost of infections contracted from a given distribution of pathogens. The theory predicts that the immune system will have more receptors for rare antigens than expected from the frequency of encounters; individuals exposed to the same infections will have sparse repertoires that are largely different, but nevertheless exploit cross-reactivity to provide the same coverage of antigens; and the optimal repertoires can be reached via the dynamics of competitive binding of antigens by receptors, and selective amplification of stimulated receptors. Our results follow from a tension between the statistics of pathogen detection, which favor a broader receptor distribution, and the effects of cross-reactivity, which tend to concentrate the optimal repertoire onto a few highly abundant clones. Our predictions can be tested in high throughput surveys of receptor and pathogen diversity.},

In general, the applica-tion of the diffusion approximation still leaves a description that is quite complex. However, in many biological applications one or more of the processes happen slowly relative to the system's other pro-cesses, and the dynamics can be approximated as occurring within a slow low-dimensional subspace. We review these time-scale separation arguments and analyse the more simple stochastic dynamics that result in a number of cases. We stress that it is important to retain the demographic noise derived in this way, and emphasise this point by showing that it can alter the direction of selection compared to the prediction made from an analysis of the corresponding deterministic model.},

Recent advances in data collection and analysis, however, are generating unprecedented amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks.},

An alternative model that allows independently fluctuating population sizes and reproduces the standard neutral evolution is reviewed. We then study a situation such that the competing species are neutral at the equilibrium population size but population size fluctuations nevertheless favor fixation of one species over the other. In this case, a separation of timescales emerges naturally and allows adiabatic elimination of a fast population size variable to deduce the fluctuations-induced selection dynamics near the equilibrium population size. The results highlight the incompleteness of the standard population genetics with a strictly fixed population size.},

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

@article{Murugan2012,
abstract = {Stochastic rearrangement of germline V-, D-, and J-genes to create variable coding sequence for certain cell surface receptors is at the origin of immune system diversity. This process, known as "VDJ recombination", is implemented via a series of stochastic molecular events involving gene choices and random nucleotide insertions between, and deletions from, genes. We use large sequence repertoires of the variable CDR3 region of human CD4+ T-cell receptor beta chains to infer the statistical properties of these basic biochemical events. Because any given CDR3 sequence can be produced in multiple ways, the probability distribution of hidden recombination events cannot be inferred directly from the observed sequences; we therefore develop a maximum likelihood inference method to achieve this end. To separate the properties of the molecular rearrangement mechanism from the effects of selection, we focus on nonproductive CDR3 sequences in T-cell DNA. We infer the joint distribution of the various generative events that occur when a new T-cell receptor gene is created. We find a rich picture of correlation (and absence thereof), providing insight into the molecular mechanisms involved. The generative event statistics are consistent between individuals, suggesting a universal biochemical process. Our probabilistic model predicts the generation probability of any specific CDR3 sequence by the primitive recombination process, allowing us to quantify the potential diversity of the T-cell repertoire and to understand why some sequences are shared between individuals. We argue that the use of formal statistical inference methods, of the kind presented in this paper, will be essential for quantitative understanding of the generation and evolution of diversity in the adaptive immune system.},

We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: How a potentially diverse population of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiates and proliferates to supply more than 10(11) mature blood cells every day in humans remains a key biological question. We investigated this process by quantitatively analyzing the clonal structure of peripheral blood that is generated by a population of transplanted lentivirus-marked HSCs in myeloablated rhesus macaques. Each transplanted HSC generates a clonal lineage of cells in the peripheral blood that is then detected and quantified through deep sequencing of the viral vector integration sites (VIS) common within each lineage. This approach allowed us to observe, over a period of 4-12 years, hundreds of distinct clonal lineages. RESULTS: While the distinct clone sizes varied by three orders of magnitude, we found that collectively, they form a steady-state clone size-distribution with a distinctive shape. Steady-state solutions of our model show that the predicted clone size-distribution is sensitive to only two combinations of parameters. By fitting the measured clone size-distributions to our mechanistic model, we estimate both the effective HSC differentiation rate and the number of active HSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our concise mathematical model shows how slow HSC differentiation followed by fast progenitor growth can be responsible for the observed broad clone size-distribution. Although all cells are assumed to be statistically identical, analogous to a neutral theory for the different clone lineages, our mathematical approach captures the intrinsic variability in the times to HSC differentiation after transplantation.},

On leaving A-state, cells enter B-phase in which their activities are deterministic, and directed towards replication. Initiation of cell replication processes is thus random, in the sense that radioactive decay is random. Cell population growth rates are determined by the probability with which cells leave the A-state, the duration of the B-phase, and the rate of cell death.

abstract = {Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single population are analyzed to determine the relative risks of extinction from demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and random catastrophes. Relative risks are assessed by comparing asymptotic scaling relationships describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases with the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each stochastic factor alone. Stochastic factors are added to a simple model of exponential growth up to K. A critical parameter affecting the extinction dynamics is {\$}\backslashbackslashtilde r,{\$} the long-run growth rate of a population below K, including stochastic factors. If r̃ is positive, with demographic stochasticity T increases asymptotically as a nearly exponential function of K, and with either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes T increases asymptotically as a power of K. If r̃ is negative, under any stochastic demographic factor, T increases asymptotically with the logarithm of K. Thus, for sufficiently large populations, the risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity is less important than that from either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes. The relative risks of extinction from environmental stochasticity and random catastrophes depend on the mean and environmental variance of population growth rate, and the magnitude and frequency of catastrophes. Contrary to previous assertions in the literature, a population of modest size subject to environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes can persist for a long time, if r̃ is substantially positive.},

New parameterization more effectively captures the phylogenetic structure of rate evolution on a tree. Fossil information and other evidence can now be included in Bayesian analyses in the form of constraints on divergence times.

Recent in vitro results conclude that strain diversity can be promoted by colicin production in a spatially structured, non-transitive interaction, as in the classic non-transitive model rock-paper-scissors (RPS). In the colicin version of the RPS model, strains that produce colicins (C) kill sensitive (S) strains, which outcompete resistant (R) strains, which outcompete C strains. Pairwise in vitro competitions between these three strains are resolved in a predictable order (C beats S, S beats R, and R beats C), but the complete system of three strains presents the opportunity for dynamic equilibrium. Here we provide conclusive evidence of an in vivo antagonistic role for colicins and show that colicins (and potentially other bacteriocins) may promote, rather than eliminate, microbial diversity in the environment.},

We show that such control is theoretically impossible if restricted to a deterministic setting, but it can be achieved readily if one exploits heterogeneities introduced at the single-cell level due to stochastic fluctuations in gene regulation. Using stochastic analyses of a bistable genetic toggle switch, we develop a control strategy that maximizes the chances that a chosen cell will express one phenotype, while the rest express another. The control mechanism uses UV radiation to enhance identically protein degradation in all cells. Control of individual cells is made possible only by monitoring stochastic protein fluctuations and applying UV control at favorable times and levels. For two identical cells, our stochastic control law can drive protein expression of a chosen cell above its neighbor with a better than 99{\%} success rate. In a population of 30 identical cells, we can drive a given cell to remain consistently within the top 20{\%}. Although cellular noise typically impairs predictability for biological responses, our results show that it can also simultaneously improve controllability for those same responses.},

Here, we show that the pattern of metagenomic sequencing read coverage for different microbial genomes contains a single trough and a single peak, the latter coinciding with the bacterial origin of replication. Furthermore, the ratio of sequencing coverage between the peak and trough provides a quantitative measure of a species' growth rate. We demonstrate this in vitro and in vivo, under different growth conditions, and in complex bacterial communities. For several bacterial species, peak-to-trough coverage ratios, but not relative abundances, correlated with the manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease and type II diabetes.},

Expanding earlier discussions, we show that the technique is statistically exact for a wide class of Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. The derivation is based on standard path-integral (path probability) ideas, but recasts the weighted-ensemble approach as simple "resampling" in path space. Similar reasoning indicates that arbitrary nonstatic binning procedures, which merely guide the resampling process, are also valid. Numerical examples confirm the claims, including the use of bins which can adaptively find the target state in a simple model.},

abstract = {Current theory predicts a distinct upper limit on the permissible degree of niche overlap; moreover, theory suggests that maximal tolerable overlap should be relatively insensitive to environmental variability. Data presented here demonstrate that, within the lizard subset of natural desert communities, niche overlap decreases both with increasing environmental variability and with increasing numbers of lizard species. The latter two factors are themselves positively correlated. A partial correlation analysis is interpreted as indicating that the extent of tolerable niche overlap does not necessarily decrease due to environmental variability, but rather that overlap is probably more closely related to the number of potential interspecific competitors in a community, or what has been termed "diffuse competition." This result lends support to the "niche overlap hypothesis," which asserts that maximal tolerable overlap should vary inversely with the intensity of competition. Moreover, this empirical discovery indicates that niche overlap theory could be profitably expanded to incorporate the number of competing species. Although the average amount of overlap between pairs of species decreases with the intensity of diffuse competition, the overall degree of competitive inhibition tolerated by individuals comprising an average species could nevertheless remain relatively constant, provided that extensive niche overlap with a few competitors is roughly equivalent to lower average overlap with a greater number of competitors.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental tenets of ecology is the Competitive Exclusion Prin- ciple. According to this principle too much interspecific competition between two species results in the exclusion of one species. This Principle is supported by a wide variety of theoretical models, of which the Lotka/Volterra model based on differential equations is the most familiar. It is perhaps less well known that difference equations also played an important role in the historical development of the Competitive Exclusion Principle. The Leslie/Gower model was used in conjunction with influential competition experiments using species of Tribolium (flour beetles) carried out in the firsthalfofthe last century. This difference equation model exhibits the same dynamic scenarios as does the Lotka/Volterra model and also supports the Competitive Exclusion Principle. A recently de- veloped competition for Tribolium species, however, exhibits a larger variety of dynamic scenarios and competitive outcomes, some of which seemingly stand in contradiction to the Principle. We discuss features of this model that differenti- ate it from the Leslie/Gower model. We give a simpler, lower dimensional “toy” model that illustrates some non-Lotka/Volterra dynamics.},

abstract = {The dynamics of a local community of competing species with weak immigration from a static regional pool is studied. Implementing the generalized competitive Lotka-Volterra model with demographic noise, a rich dynamics structure with four qualitatively distinct phases is unfolded. When the overall interspecies competition is weak, the island species are a sample of the mainland species. For higher values of the competition parameter the system still admit an equilibrium community, but now some of the mainland species are absent on the island. Further increase in competition leads to an intermittent "chaotic" phase, where the dynamics is controlled by invadable combinations of species and the turnover rate is governed by the migration. Finally, the strong competition phase is glassy, dominated by uninvadable state and noise-induced transitions. Our model contains, as a spatial case, the celebrated neutral island theories of Wilson-MacArthur and Hubbell. Moreover, we show that slight deviations from perfect neutrality may lead to each of the phases, as the Hubbell point appears to be quadracritical.},

Analysis of the combined model was not performed in the original 1943 paper. The Luria-Delbruck paper also did not consider the possibility of neither model fitting the experiment. Using Bayesian model selection, we find that the Luria-Delbruck experiment, indeed, favors the Darwinian evolution over purely Lamarckian.

abstract = {RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations. It is thought that diversity and genetic structure of viral populations determine the rapid adaptation observed in RNA viruses and hence their pathogenesis. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus evolution has been limited by the inability to accurately describe the genetic structure of virus populations. Next-generation sequencing technologies generate data of sufficient depth to characterize virus populations, but are limited in their utility because most variants are present at very low frequencies and are thus indistinguishable from next-generation sequencing errors. Here we present an approach that reduces next-generation sequencing errors and allows the description of virus populations with unprecedented accuracy. Using this approach, we define the mutation rates of poliovirus and uncover the mutation landscape of the population. Furthermore, by monitoring changes in variant frequencies on serially passaged populations, we determined fitness values for thousands of mutations across the viral genome. Mapping of these fitness values onto three-dimensional structures of viral proteins offers a powerful approach for exploring structure-function relationships and potentially uncovering new functions. To our knowledge, our study provides the first single-nucleotide fitness landscape of an evolving RNA virus and establishes a general experimental platform for studying the genetic changes underlying the evolution of virus populations.},

abstract = {This paper deals with a mathematical model for a disease where the death rate depends on the number of people in the population. This sort of model would be suitable for diseases in developing countries or for diseases amongst animal and insect populations. We also assume that the population under consideration is regulated by the disease so that there is a mortality induced by the disease. We use a compartmental model and perform an equilibrium and stability analysis to find that there is a threshold condition. If the threshold is exceeded, then there is a unique equilibrium with disease present which is locally stable to small perturbations. We conclude by looking at several specific models and seeing how the results relate to previous work. �� 1990 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Population ecologists have traditionally focused on the patterns and causes of population variation in the temporal domain for which a substantial body of practical analytic techniques have been developed. More recently, numerous studies have documented how populations may fluctuate synchronously over large spatial areas; analyses of such spatially extended time-series have started to provide additional clues regarding the causes of these population fluctuations and explanations for their synchronous occurrence. Here, we report on the development of a phase-based method for identifying coupling between temporally coincident but spatially distributed cyclic time-series, which we apply to the numbers of muskrat and mink recorded at 81 locations across Canada. The analysis reveals remarkable parallel clines in the strength of coupling between proximate populations of both species--declining from west to east--together with a corresponding increase in observed synchrony between these populations the further east they are located.},

abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection (FSP) method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or tau leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and tau leaping algorithms. In both examples, the FSP outperforms the SSA in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the FSP also performs far more effectively than tau leaping methods.},

abstract = {Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are diverse and widespread in the prokaryotic kingdom. They are composed of closely linked genes encoding a stable toxin that can harm the host cell and its cognate labile antitoxin, which protects the host from the toxin's deleterious effect. TA systems are thought to invade bacterial genomes through horizontal gene transfer. Some TA systems might behave as selfish elements and favour their own maintenance at the expense of their host. As a consequence, they may contribute to the maintenance of plasmids or genomic islands, such as super-integrons, by post-segregational killing of the cell that loses these genes and so suffers the stable toxin's destructive effect. The function of the chromosomally encoded TA systems is less clear and still open to debate. This Review discusses current hypotheses regarding the biological roles of these evolutionarily successful small operons. We consider the various selective forces that could drive the maintenance of TA systems in bacterial genomes.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature is found to be a consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and new vertices attach preferentially to already well connected sites. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, indicating that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

abstract = {The brain map project aims to map out the neuron connections of the human brain. Even with all of the wirings mapped out, the global and physical understandings of the function and behavior are still challenging. Hopfield quantified the learning and memory process of symmetrically connected neural networks globally through equilibrium energy. The energy basins of attractions represent memories, and the memory retrieval dynamics is determined by the energy gradient. However, the realistic neural networks are asymmetrically connected, and oscillations cannot emerge from symmetric neural networks. Here, we developed a nonequilibrium landscape–flux theory for realistic asymmetrically connected neural networks. We uncovered the underlying potential landscape and the associated Lyapunov function for quantifying the global stability and function. We found the dynamics and oscillations in human brains responsible for cognitive processes and physiological rhythm regulations are determined not only by the landscape gradient but also by the flux. We found that the flux is closely related to the degrees of the asymmetric connections in neural networks and is the origin of the neural oscillations. The neural oscillation landscape shows a closed-ring attractor topology. The landscape gradient attracts the network down to the ring. The flux is responsible for coherent oscillations on the ring. We suggest the flux may provide the driving force for associations among memories. We applied our theory to rapid-eye movement sleep cycle. We identified the key regulation factors for function through global sensitivity analysis of landscape topography against wirings, which are in good agreements with experiments.},

abstract = {Deterministic evolutionary theory robustly predicts that populations displaying altruistic behaviours will be driven to extinction by mutant cheats that absorb common benefits but do not themselves contribute. Here we show that when demographic stochasticity is accounted for, selection can in fact act in the reverse direction to that predicted deterministically, instead favouring cooperative behaviors that appreciably increase the carrying capacity of the population. Populations that exist in larger numbers experience a selective advantage by being more stochastically robust to invasions than smaller populations, and this advantage can persist even in the presence of reproductive costs. We investigate this general effect in the specific context of public goods production and find conditions for stochastic selection reversal leading to the success of public good producers. This insight, developed here analytically, is missed by both the deterministic analysis as well as standard game theoretic models that enforce a fixed population size. The effect is found to be amplified by space; in this scenario we find that selection reversal occurs within biologically reasonable parameter regimes for microbial populations. Beyond the public good problem, we formulate a general mathematical framework for models that may exhibit stochastic selection reversal. In this context, we describe a stochastic analogue to r-K theory, by which small populations can evolve to higher densities in the absence of disturbance.},

Eliciting these antibodies via vaccination appears to be remarkably difficult, not least because they arise late in infection and are highly mutated relative to germline antibody sequences. Here, using a computational model, we show that broad antibodies could in fact emerge earlier and be less mutated, but that they may be prevented from doing so as a result of competitive exclusion by the autologous antibody response. We further find that this competitive exclusion is weaker in infections founded by multiple distinct strains, with broadly neutralizing antibodies emerging earlier than in infections founded by a single strain. Our computational model simulates coevolving multitype virus and antibody populations. Broadly neutralizing antibodies may therefore be easier for the adaptive immune system to generate than previously thought. If less mutated broad antibodies exist, it may be possible to elicit them with a vaccine containing a mixture of diverse virus strains.},

In a strictly unvarying (deterministic) environment, there is in general no limit to the degree of overlap, short of complete congruence. However, in a fluctuating (stochastic) environment, the average food sizes for species adjacent on the resource spectrum must differ by an amount roughly equal to the standard deviation in the food size taken by either individual species. This mathematical result emerges in a nonobvious yet robust way for environmental fluctuations whose variance relative to their mean ranges from around 0.01{\%} to around 30{\%}. In short, there is an effective limit to niche overlap in the real world, and this limit is insensitive to the degree of environmental fluctuation, unless it be very severe.

abstract = {Demographic stochasticity, the random fluctuations arising from the intrinsic discreteness of populations and the uncertainty of individual birth and death events, is an essential feature of population dynamics. Nevertheless theoretical investigations often neglect this naturally occurring noise due to the mathematical complexity of stochastic models. This paper reports the results of analytical and computational investigations of models of competitive population dynamics, specifically the competition between species in heterogeneous environments with different phenotypes of dispersal, fully accounting for demographic stochasticity. A novel asymptotic approximation is introduced and applied to derive remarkably simple analytical forms for key statistical quantities describing the populations' dynamical evolution. These formulas characterize the selection processes that determine which (if either) competitor has an evolutionary advantage. The theory is verified by large-scale numerical simulations. We discover that the fluctuations can (1) break dynamical degeneracies, (2) support polymorphism that does not exist in deterministic models, (3) reverse the direction of the weak selection and cause shifts in selection regimes, and (4) allow for the emergence of evolutionarily stable dispersal rates. Dynamical mechanisms and time scales of the fluctuation-induced phenomena are identified within the theoretical approach.},

abstract = {Human associated microbial communities exert tremendous influence over human health and disease. With modern metagenomic sequencing methods it is now possible to follow the relative abundance of microbes in a community over time. These microbial communities exhibit rich ecological dynamics and an important goal of microbial ecology is to infer the ecological interactions between species directly from sequence data. Any algorithm for inferring ecological interactions must overcome three major obstacles: 1) a correlation between the abundances of two species does not imply that those species are interacting, 2) the sum constraint on the relative abundances obtained from metagenomic studies makes it difficult to infer the parameters in timeseries models, and 3) errors due to experimental uncertainty, or mis-assignment of sequencing reads into operational taxonomic units, bias inferences of species interactions due to a statistical problem called "errors-in-variables". Here we introduce an approach, Learning Interactions from MIcrobial Time Series (LIMITS), that overcomes these obstacles. LIMITS uses sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to infer a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics. We tested LIMITS on synthetic data and showed that it could reliably infer the topology of the inter-species ecological interactions. We then used LIMITS to characterize the species interactions in the gut microbiomes of two individuals and found that the interaction networks varied significantly between individuals. Furthermore, we found that the interaction networks of the two individuals are dominated by distinct "keystone species", Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroided stercosis, that have a disproportionate influence on the structure of the gut microbiome even though they are only found in moderate abundance. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the abundances of certain keystone species may be responsible for individuality in the human gut microbiome.},

We show that such systems converge to outcomes (proportions or concentrations) that are represented by the stable fixed points of these functions. These limit theorems are strong laws of large numbers for path-dependent increments, and as such they generalize the standard Borel strong law for independent increments. They are powerful and easy to use. We show applications in chemical kinetics, industrial location theory and in the emergence of technological structure in the economy. ?? 1987.},

The NKR gene family shows a remarkable genetic diversity, containing several genes encoding receptors with activating and inhibiting signaling, and varying in gene content and allelic polymorphism. The expansion of the NKR genes is species-specific, with different species evolving alternative expanded NKR genes, which encode structurally different proteins, yet perform comparable functions. So far, the biological function of this expansion within the NKR cluster has remained poorly understood. To study the evolution of NKRs, we have developed an agent-based model implementing a coevolutionary scenario between hosts and herpes-like viruses that are able to evade the immune response by downregulating the expression of MHC-I on the cell surface. We show that hosts evolve specific inhibitory NKRs, specialized to particular MHC-I alleles in the population. Viruses in our simulations readily evolve proteins mimicking the MHC molecules of their host, even in the absence of MHC-I downregulation. As a result, the NKR locus becomes polygenic and polymorphic, encoding both specific inhibiting and activating receptors to optimally protect the hosts from coevolving viruses. },

abstract = {Defense against pathogen, parasites and herbivores is often enhanced after their invasion into the host's body. Sometimes different options are adopted depending on the identity and the quantity of the pathogen, exemplified by the switch between Th1 and Th2 systems in mammalian immunity. In this paper, we study the optimal defense of the host when two alternative responses are available, which differ in the effectiveness of suppressing the growth of pathogen (parasite, or herbivore), the damage to the host caused by the defense response, and the magnitude of time delay before the defense response becomes fully effective. The optimal defense is the one that minimizes the sum of the damages caused by the pathogen and the cost due to defense activities. The damage by pathogens increases in proportion to the time integral of the pathogen abundance, and the cost is proportional to the defense activity. We can prove that a single globally optimal combination of defense options always exists and there is no other local optimum. Depending on the parameters, the optimal is to adopt only the early response, only the late response, or both responses. The defense response with a shorter time delay is more heavily used when the pathogen grows fast, the initial pathogen abundance is large, and the difference in time delay is long. We also study the host's optimal choice between constitutive and inducible defenses. In the constitutive defense, the response to pathogen attack works without delay, but it causes the cost even when the pathogen attack does not occur. We discuss mammalian immunity and the plant chemical defense from the model's viewpoint.},

We focus on stochastic properties of fixation: how a strategy represented by a single individual wins over the entire population. The process is discussed in the framework of a random walk with site dependent hopping rates. The time of fixation is found to be identical for both strategies in any particular game. The asymptotic behavior of the fixation time and fixation probabilities in the large population size limit is also discussed. We show that fixation is fast when there is at least one pure evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) in the infinite population size limit, while fixation is slow when the ESS is the coexistence of the two strategies.},

abstract = {Ecological systems are complex assemblies of large numbers of individuals, interacting competitively under multifaceted environmental conditions. Recent studies using microbial laboratory communities have revealed some of the self-organization principles underneath the complexity of these systems. A major role of the inherent stochasticity of its dynamics and the spatial segregation of different interacting species into distinct patterns has thereby been established. It ensures the viability of microbial colonies by allowing for species diversity, cooperative behavior and other kinds of "social" behavior. A synthesis of evolutionary game theory, nonlinear dynamics, and the theory of stochastic processes provides the mathematical tools and a conceptual framework for a deeper understanding of these ecological systems. We give an introduction into the modern formulation of these theories and illustrate their effectiveness focussing on selected examples of microbial systems. Intrinsic fluctuations, stemming from the discreteness of individuals, are ubiquitous, and can have an important impact on the stability of ecosystems. In the absence of speciation, extinction of species is unavoidable. It may, however, take very long times. We provide a general concept for defining survival and extinction on ecological time-scales. Spatial degrees of freedom come with a certain mobility of individuals. When the latter is sufficiently high, bacterial community structures can be understood through mapping individual-based models, in a continuum approach, onto stochastic partial differential equations. These allow progress using methods of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcation analysis and invariant manifolds. We conclude with a perspective on the current challenges in quantifying bacterial pattern formation, and how this might have an impact on fundamental research in non-equilibrium physics. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A widespread feature of extracellular signaling in cell circuits is paradoxical pleiotropy: the same secreted signaling molecule can induce opposite effects in the responding cells. For example, the cytokine IL-2 can promote proliferation and death of T cells. The role of such paradoxical signaling remains unclear. To address this, we studied CD4+ T cell expansion in culture. We found that cells with a 30-fold difference in initial concentrations reached a homeostatic concentration nearly independent of initial cell levels. Below an initial threshold, cell density decayed to extinction (OFF-state). We show that these dynamics relate to the paradoxical effect of IL-2, which increases the proliferation rate cooperatively and the death rate linearly. Mathematical modeling explained the observed cell and cytokine dynamics and predicted conditions that shifted cell fate from homeostasis to the OFF-state. We suggest that paradoxical signaling provides cell circuits with specific dynamical features that are robust to environmental perturbations. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In applications to biological, ecological, chemical and social dynamics it is common for these models to posses quantities that are approximately conserved on short timescales, in which case system trajectories are observed to remain close to some lower-dimensional subspace. Here, we derive explicit and general formulae for a reduced-dimension description of such processes that is exact in the limit of small noise and well-separated slow and fast dynamics. The Michaelis-Menten law of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and the link between the Lotka-Voltera and Wright-Fisher processes are explored as a simple worked examples. Extensions of the method are presented for infinite dimensional systems and processes coupled to non-Gaussian noise sources.},

abstract = {Tumors initiate when a population of proliferating cells accumulates a certain number and type of genetic and/or epigenetic alterations. The population dynamics of such sequential acquisition of (epi)genetic alterations has been the topic of much investigation. The phenomenon of stochastic tunneling, where an intermediate mutant in a sequence does not reach fixation in a population before generating a double mutant, has been studied using a variety of computational and mathematical methods. However, the field still lacks a comprehensive analytical description since theoretical predictions of fixation times are available only for cases in which the second mutant is advantageous. Here, we study stochastic tunneling in a Moran model. Analyzing the deterministic dynamics of large populations we systematically identify the parameter regimes captured by existing approaches. Our analysis also reveals fitness landscapes and mutation rates for which finite populations are found in long-lived metastable states. These are landscapes in which the final mutant is not the most advantageous in the sequence, and resulting metastable states are a consequence of a mutation-selection balance. The escape from these states is driven by intrinsic noise, and their location affects the probability of tunneling. Existing methods no longer apply. In these regimes it is the escape from the metastable states that is the key bottleneck; fixation is no longer limited by the emergence of a successful mutant lineage. We used the so-called Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method to compute fixation times in these parameter regimes, successfully validated by stochastic simulations. Our work fills a gap left by previous approaches and provides a more comprehensive description of the acquisition of multiple mutations in populations of somatic cells.},

As opposed to the usual assumption of constant pop- ulation size, we allow for stochastically varying population sizes. This is implemented by a stochastic competitive Lotka-Volterra model. The compe- tition coefficients are interpreted in terms of inverse payoffs emerging from an evolutionary game. Since our study focuses on the impact of the competition values, we assume the same birth and death rates for both types. In this gen- eral framework, we derive an approximate formula for the fixation probability {\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}phi{\}} of the mutant type under weak selection. The qualitative behavior of {\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}phi{\}} when compared to the neutral scenario is governed by the invasion dynamics of an initially rare type. Higher payoffs when competing with the resident type yield higher values of {\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}phi{\}}.

abstract = {Growth in static and controlled environments such as a Petri dish can be used to study the spatial population dynamics of microorganisms. However, natural populations such as marine microbes experience fluid advection and often grow up in heterogeneous environments. We investigate a generalized Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piscounov (FKPP) equation describing single species population subject to a constant flow field and quenched random spatially inhomogeneous growth rates with a fertile overall growth condition. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that the non-equilibrium steady-state population density develops a flow-driven striation pattern. The striations are highly asymmetric with a longitudinal correlation length that diverges linearly with the flow speed and a transverse correlation length that approaches a finite velocity-independent value. Linear response theory is developed to study the statistics of the steady states. Theoretical predictions show excellent agreement with the numerical steady states of the generalized FKPP equation obtained from Lattice Boltzmann simulations. These findings suggest that, although the growth disorder can be spatially uncorrelated, correlated population structures with striations emerge naturally at sufficiently strong advection.},

Linear dsDNA translocation events were selected based on the magnitude of current blockage and accumulated into scatter plots of current blockage and event duration (translocation time). The translocation time distribution was fitted to the solution of a Smoluchowski-type equation for 1D biased diffusion to a sink. The DNA drifting speed under bias and diffusion constant were extracted from the fits as functions of solution viscosity, applied voltage and DNA chain length. Combined with the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation, this model allowed evaluation of the viscous drag force on DNA molecules. This model also allowed estimation of the uncertainty in determining the DNA chain length due to the influence of friction on the spread of translocation times in a nanopore measurement. The data analysis suggests that the simple 1D biased diffusion model fits the experimental data well for a wide range of conditions. Some deviations from predicted behavior were observed and show where additional phenomena are likely to contribute to the distribution of DNA translocation times.},

We perturbed an empirical sagebrush steppe community model to remove the demographic effect of niche differences and quantify their impact on coexistence. With stabilizing mechanisms operating, all species showed positive growth rates when rare, generating stable coexistence. Fluctuation-independent mechanisms contributed more than temporal variability to coexistence and operated more strongly on recruitment than growth or survival. As expected, removal of stabilizing niche differences led to extinction of all inferior competitors. However, complete exclusion required 300– 400 years, indicating small fitness differences among species.

As long as both genes are expressed, cells carrying the complex can remain healthy. However, loss of the complex (including segregational loss in daughter cells) can entail death of the cell. We develop a theoretical model to explore a number of evolutionary puzzles posed by toxin-antitoxin (TA) population biology. We first extend earlier results demonstrating that TA complexes can spread on plasmids, as an adaptation to plasmid competition in spatially structured environments, and highlight the role of kin selection. We then considered the emergence of TA complexes on plasmids from previously unlinked toxin and antitoxin genes. We find that one of these traits must offer at least initially a direct advantage in some but not all environments encountered by the evolving plasmid population. Finally, our study predicts non-transitive 'rock-paper-scissors' dynamics to be a feature of intragenomic conflict mediated by TA complexes. Intragenomic conflict could be sufficient to select deleterious genes on chromosomes and helps to explain the previously perplexing observation that many TA genes are found on bacterial chromosomes.},

For example, kinetic proofreading processes rely upon numerous sequential reactions in order to guarantee the precise construction of specific macromolecules. In this work, we study the transient properties of such systems and fully characterize their first passage (completion) time distributions. In particular, we provide explicit expressions for the mean and the variance of the completion time for a kinetic proofreading process and computational analyses for more complicated biochemical systems. We find that, for a wide range of parameters, as the system size grows, the completion time behavior simplifies: it becomes either deterministic or exponentially distributed, with a very narrow transition between the two regimes. In both regimes, the dynamical complexity of the full system is trivial compared to its apparent structural complexity. Similar simplicity is likely to arise in the dynamics of many complex multistep biochemical processes. In particular, these findings suggest not only that one may not be able to understand individual elementary reactions from macroscopic observations, but also that such an understanding may be unnecessary.},

abstract = {The intestinal microbiota consists of over 1000 species, which play key roles in gut physiology and homeostasis. Imbalances in the composition of this bacterial community can lead to transient intestinal dysfunctions and chronic disease states. Understanding how to manipulate this ecosystem is thus essential for treating many disorders. In this study, we took advantage of recently developed tools for deep sequencing and phylogenetic clustering to examine the long-term effects of exogenous microbiota transplantation combined with and without an antibiotic pretreatment. In our rat model, deep sequencing revealed an intestinal bacterial diversity exceeding that of the human gut by a factor of two to three. The transplantation produced a marked increase in the microbial diversity of the recipients, which stemmed from both capture of new phylotypes and increase in abundance of others. However, when transplantation was performed after antibiotic intake, the resulting state simply combined the reshaping effects of the individual treatments (including the reduced diversity from antibiotic treatment alone). Therefore, lowering the recipient bacterial load by antibiotic intake prior to transplantation did not increase establishment of the donor phylotypes, although some dominant lineages still transferred successfully. Remarkably, all of these effects were observed after 1 mo of treatment and persisted after 3 mo. Overall, our results indicate that the indigenous gut microbial composition is more plastic that previously anticipated. However, since antibiotic pretreatment counterintuitively interferes with the establishment of an exogenous community, such plasticity is likely conditioned more by the altered microbiome gut homeostasis caused by antibiotics than by the primary bacterial loss.},

abstract = {The accumulation of evidence that ecologically important traits often evolve at the same time and rate as ecological dynamics (e.g., changes in species' abundances or spatial distributions) has outpaced theory describing the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes with comparable timescales. The disparity between experiment and theory is partially due to the high dimensionality of models that include both evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Here we show how the theory of fast-slow dynamical systems can be used to reduce model dimension, and we use that body of theory to study a general predator-prey system exhibiting fast evolution in either the predator or the prey. Our approach yields graphical methods with predictive power about when new and unique dynamics (e.g., completely out-of-phase oscillations and cryptic dynamics) can arise in ecological systems exhibiting fast evolution. In addition, we derive analytical expressions for determining when such behavior arises and how evolution affects qualitative properties of the ecological dynamics. Finally, while the theory requires a separation of timescales between the ecological and evolutionary processes, our approach yields insight into systems where the rates of those processes are comparable and thus is a step toward creating a general ecoevolutionary theory.},

We examine two popular approaches to this problem, the coalescent and the birth-death-sampling model (BDM), in the context of estimating population size and birth rates in a population growing exponentially according to the birth-death branching process. For sequences sampled at a single time, we found the coalescent and the BDM gave virtually indistinguishable results in terms of the growth rates and fraction of the population sampled, even when sampling from a small population. For sequences sampled at multiple time points, we find that the birth-death model estimators are subject to large bias if the sampling process is misspecified. Since BDMs incorporate a model of the sampling process, we show how much of the statistical power of BDMs arises from the sequence of sample times and not from the genealogical tree. This motivates the development of a new coalescent estimator, which is augmented with a model of the known sampling process and is potentially more precise than the coalescent that does not use sample time information.},

abstract = {Networks of interacting proteins orchestrate the responses of living cells to a variety of external stimuli, but how sensitive is the functioning of these protein networks to variations in their biochemical parameters? One possibility is that to achieve appropriate function, the reaction rate constants and enzyme concentrations need to be adjusted in a precise manner, and any deviation from these 'fine-tuned' values ruins the network's performance. An alternative possibility is that key properties of biochemical networks are robust; that is, they are insensitive to the precise values of the biochemical parameters. Here we address this issue in experiments using chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, one of the best-characterized sensory systems. We focus on how response and adaptation to attractant signals vary with systematic changes in the intracellular concentration of the components of the chemotaxis network. We find that some properties, such as steady-state behaviour and adaptation time, show strong variations in response to varying protein concentrations. In contrast, the precision of adaptation is robust and does not vary with the protein concentrations. This is consistent with a recently proposed molecular mechanism for exact adaptation, where robustness is a direct consequence of the network's architecture.},

For the anteroposterior axis of the Drosophila embryo, the first step in this process depends on a spatial gradient of the maternal morphogen Bicoid (Bcd). Positional information of this gradient is transmitted to downstream gap genes, each occupying a well defined spatial domain. We determined the precision of the initial process by comparing expression domains in different embryos. Here we show that the Bcd gradient displays a high embryo-to-embryo variability, but that this noise in the positional information is strongly decreased ('filtered') at the level of hunchback (hb) gene expression. In contrast to the Bcd gradient, the hb expression pattern already includes the information about the scale of the embryo. We show that genes known to interact directly with Hb are not responsible for its spatial precision, but that the maternal gene staufen may be crucial.},

abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the “reaction-rate equations”); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the “master equation”). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this “stochastic simulation algorithm” correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

The CF lung microbiota shows significant inter-individual variability in community structure, composition and diversity. The core microbiota consists of five genera - Streptococcus, Prevotella, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces. CF-associated pathogens such as Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter are less prevalent than core genera, but have a strong tendency to dominate the bacterial community when present. Community diversity and lung function are greatest in patients less than 10 years of age and lower in older age groups, plateauing at approximately age 25. Lower community diversity correlates with worse lung function in a multivariate regression model. Infection by Pseudomonas correlates with age-associated trends in community diversity and lung function.},

abstract = {A stochastic, agent-based mathematical model of the coevolution of the archaeal and bacterial adaptive immunity system, CRISPR-Cas, and lytic viruses shows that CRISPR-Cas immunity can stabilize the virus-host coexistence rather than leading to the extinction of the virus. In the model, CRISPR-Cas immunity does not specifically promote viral diversity, presumably because the selection pressure on each single proto-spacer is too weak. However, the overall virus diversity in the presence of CRISPR-Cas grows due to the increase of the host and, accordingly, the virus population size. Above a threshold value of total viral diversity, which is proportional to the viral mutation rate and population size, the CRISPR-Cas system becomes ineffective and is lost due to the associated fitness cost. Our previous modeling study has suggested that the ubiquity of CRISPR-Cas in hyperthermophiles, which contrasts its comparative low prevalence in mesophiles, is due to lower rates of mutation fixation in thermal habitats. The present findings offer a complementary, simpler perspective on this contrast through the larger population sizes of mesophiles compared to hyperthermophiles, because of which CRISPR-Cas can become ineffective in mesophiles. The efficacy of CRISPR-Cas sharply increases with the number of proto-spacers per viral genome, potentially explaining the low information content of the proto-spacer-associated motif (PAM) that is required for spacer acquisition by CRISPR-Cas because a higher specificity would restrict the number of spacers available to CRISPR-Cas, thus hampering immunity. The very existence of the PAM might reflect the tradeoff between the requirement of diverse spacers for efficient immunity and avoidance of autoimmunity.},

abstract = {The origin of cooperation is a central challenge to our understanding of evolution. The fact that microbial interactions can be manipulated in ways that animal interactions cannot has led to a growing interest in microbial models of cooperation and competition. For the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to grow on sucrose, the disaccharide must first be hydrolysed by the enzyme invertase. This hydrolysis reaction is performed outside the cytoplasm in the periplasmic space between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. Here we demonstrate that the vast majority ( approximately 99 per cent) of the monosaccharides created by sucrose hydrolysis diffuse away before they can be imported into the cell, serving to make invertase production and secretion a cooperative behaviour. A mutant cheater strain that does not produce invertase is able to take advantage of and invade a population of wild-type cooperator cells. However, over a wide range of conditions, the wild-type cooperator can also invade a population of cheater cells. Therefore, we observe steady-state coexistence between the two strains in well-mixed culture resulting from the fact that rare strategies outperform common strategies-the defining features of what game theorists call the snowdrift game. A model of the cooperative interaction incorporating nonlinear benefits explains the origin of this coexistence. We are able to alter the outcome of the competition by varying either the cost of cooperation or the glucose concentration in the media. Finally, we note that glucose repression of invertase expression in wild-type cells produces a strategy that is optimal for the snowdrift game-wild-type cells cooperate only when competing against cheater cells.},

In some studies, CTLs were found to kill a large fraction of the productively infected cells relative to the viral cytopathicity, whereas in others CTLs were suggested to kill only a small fraction of infected cells. In this review, we compile published estimates of CTL-mediated death rates, and examine whether these studies permit determining the rate at which CTLs kill HIV-1 infected cells. We highlight potential misinterpretations of the CTL-killing rates from the escape rates of mutants, and from perturbations of the steady state viral load during chronic infection. Our major conclusion is that CTL-mediated killing rates remain unknown. But contrary to current consensus, we argue that killing rates higher than one per day are perfectly consistent with the experimental data, which would imply that the majority of the productively infected cells could still die from CTL-mediated killing rather than from viral cytopathicity.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory circuits with different architectures (patterns of regulatory interactions) can generate similar dynamics. This raises the question of why a particular circuit architecture is selected to implement a given cellular process. To investigate this problem, we compared the Bacillus subtilis circuit that regulates differentiation into the competence state to an engineered circuit with an alternative architecture (SynEx) in silico and in vivo. Time-lapse microscopy measurements showed that SynEx cells generated competence dynamics similar to native cells and reconstituted the physiology of differentiation. However, architectural differences between the circuits altered the dynamic distribution of stochastic fluctuations (noise) during circuit operation. This distinction in noise causes functional differences between the circuits by selectively controlling the timing of competence episodes and response of the system to various DNA concentrations. These results reveal a tradeoff between temporal precision and physiological response range that is controlled by distinct noise characteristics of alternative circuit architectures. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The colonization process of the infant gut microbiome has been called chaotic, but this view could reflect insufficient documentation of the factors affecting the microbiome. We performed a 2.5-y case study of the assembly of the human infant gut microbiome, to relate life events to microbiome composition and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of {\textgreater}300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ≈ 500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present before the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis, and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome. This study revealed that seemingly chaotic shifts in the microbiome are associated with life events; however, additional experiments ought to be conducted to assess how different infants respond to similar life events.},

abstract = {Community ecology has traditionally relied on the competitive exclusion principle, a piece of common wisdom in conceptual frameworks developed to describe species assemblages. Key concepts in community ecology, such as limiting similarity and niche partitioning, are based on competitive exclusion. However, this classical paradigm in ecology relies on implications derived from simple, deterministic models. Here we show how the predictions of a symmetric, deterministic model about the way extinctions proceed can be utterly different from the results derived from the same model when ecological drift (demographic stochasticity) is explicitly considered. Using analytical approximations to the steady-state conditional probabilities for assemblages with two and three species, we demonstrate that stochastic competitive exclusion leads to a cascade of extinctions, whereas the symmetric, deterministic model predicts a multiple collapse of species. To test the robustness of our results, we have studied the effect of environmental stochasticity and relaxed the species symmetry assumption. Our conclusions highlight the crucial role of stochasticity when deriving reliable theoretical predictions for species community assembly.},

Deleterious mutations of small effect can escape natural selection, and should accumulate in small population. Reduced fitness from deleterious-mutation accumulation may be important in the evolution of sex, mate choice, and diploid life-cycles, and in the extinction of small populations. Few empirical data exist, however. Minimum estimates of the genomic deleterious-mutation rate for viability in Drosophila melanogaster are surprisingly high, leading to the conjecture that the rate for total fitness could exceed 1.0 mutation per individual per generation. Here we use Escherichia coli to provide an estimate of the genomic deleterious-mutation rate for total fitness in a microbe. We estimate that the per-microbe rate of deleterious mutations is in excess of 0.0002.},

In particular, the main drivers of environmental change strongly affect the strength of interspecific interactions with considerable consequences for biodiversity. However, extrapolating the effects observed on pair-wise interactions to entire ecological networks is challenging. Here we propose a framework to estimate the tolerance to changes in the strength of mutualistic interaction that species in mutualistic networks can sustain before becoming extinct. We identify the scenarios where generalist species can be the least tolerant. We show that the least tolerant species across different scenarios do not appear to have uniquely common characteristics. Species' tolerance is extremely sensitive to the direction of change in the strength of mutualistic interaction, as well as to the observed mutualistic trade-offs between the number of partners and the strength of the interactions.},

We show how to measure this information, in bits, using the gap genes in the Drosophila embryo as an example. Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much as would be expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define a cell's location with an error bar of {\~{}}1 along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of information from primary morphogen inputs to the output of the gap gene network.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks.

By studying the mean extinction times of cooperators and defectors, a variable sensitive to fluctuations, we are able to identify and quantify an emerging 'edge of neutral evolution' that delineates regimes of neutral and Darwinian evolution. Our results reveal that cooperation is significantly maintained in the neutral regimes. In contrast, the classical predictions of evolutionary game theory, where defectors beat cooperators, are recovered in the Darwinian regimes. Our studies demonstrate that fluctuations can provide a surprisingly simple way to partly resolve social dilemmas. Our methods are generally applicable to estimate the role of random drift in evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Kinetic proofreading is a reaction scheme with a structure more complicated than that of Michaelis kinetics, which leads to a proofreading for errors in the recognition of a correct substrate by an enzyme. We have measured the stoichiometry between ATP hydrolysis and tRNAIle charging, using the enzyme isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase [L-isoleucine:tRNAIle ligase (AMP-forming), EC 6.1.1.5] and the amino acids isoleucine (correct) and valine (incorrect). The enzymatic deacylation of charged tRNA, which would normally prevent meaningful stoichiometry studies, was eliminated by the use of transfer factor Tu-GTP, (which binds strongly to charged tRNA) in the reaction mixture. For isoleucine, 1.5 ATP molecules are hydrolyzed per tRNA charged, but for valine, 270. These stoichiometry ratios are fundamental to kinetic proofreading, for the energy coupling is essential and proofreading is obtained only by departing from 1:1 stoichiometry between energy coupling and product formation. Within the known reaction pathway, these ratios demonstrate that kinetic proofreading induces a reduction in errors by a factor of 1/180. An overall error rate of about 10(-4) for tRNA charging is obtained by a kinetic proofreading using a fundamental discrimination level of about 10(-2), and is compatible with the low in vivo error rate of protein synthesis.},

abstract = {s Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexis-tence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantifica-tion shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific inter-actions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are es-sential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coex-istence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

The model is based on the dynamics of species turnover in microsites, and incorporates localized competition, non-uniform seed dispersal and aspects of spatiotemporal environmental heterogeneity. These factors, which are not included in most standard competition models, allow stable coexistence of trophically equivalent species due to: (a) Differences in life-history 'strategy'. (b) Input of seeds from nearby habitats (spatial Mass Effect). (c) Differences in demographic responses to environmental fluctuations (temporal Mass Effect). (d) Turnover in species composition between different habitat patches. Quantitative descriptive studies are presented, demonstrating the occurrence of vegetation patterns predicted on the basis of the hypothesized mechanisms. We also review previously proposed mechanisms that would allow trophically equivalent species to coexist, and explore the theoretical and methodological implications of recognizing coexistence mechanisms independent of trophic niche differentiation. In particular, we propose that these mechanisms contribute to the dissimilarity of within-community replicate samples and the maintenance of many rare species in plant communities.},

Antibodies that protect against highly mutable pathogens must neutralize diverse strains. Developing effective immunization strategies to drive their evolution requires understanding how affinity maturation happens in an environment where variants of the same antigen are present. We present an in silico model of affinity maturation driven by antigen variants which reveals that induction of cross-reactive antibodies often occurs with low probability because conflicting selection forces, imposed by different antigen variants, can frustrate affinity maturation. We describe how variables such as temporal pattern of antigen administration influence the outcome of this frustrated evolutionary process. Our calculations predict, and experiments in mice with variant gp120 constructs of the HIV envelope protein confirm, that sequential immunization with antigen variants is preferred over a cocktail for induction of cross-reactive antibodies focused on the shared CD4 binding site epitope.},

Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one discrete state to another.},

abstract = {Bacteriocin production is a spiteful behavior of bacteria that is central to the competitive dynamics of many human pathogens. Social evolution predicts that bacteriocin production is favored when bacteriocin-producing cells are mixed at intermediate frequency with their competitors and when competitive neighborhoods are localized. Both predictions are supported by biofilm experiments. However, the means by which physical and biological processes interact to produce conditions that favor the evolution of bacteriocin production remain to be investigated. Here we fill this gap using analytical and computational approaches. We identify and collapse key parameters into a single number, the critical bacteriocin range, that measures the threshold distance from a focal bacteriocin-producing cell within which its fitness is higher than that of a sensitive cell. We develop an agent-based model to test our predictions and confirm that bacteriocin production is most favored when relatedness is intermediate and competition is local. We then use invasion analysis to determine evolutionarily stable strategies for bacteriocin production. Finally, we perform long-term evolutionary simulations to analyze how the critical bacteriocin range and genetic lineage segregation affect biodiversity in multistrain biofilms. We find that biodiversity is maintained in highly segregated biofilms for a wide array of critical bacteriocin ranges. However, under conditions of high nutrient penetration leading to well-mixed biofilms, biodiversity rapidly decreases and becomes sensitive to the critical bacteriocin range.},

abstract = {Nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport via their affinity for unstructured proteins (polymers) in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Here, we have modeled the effect of NTRs on polymeric structure in the nanopore confinement of the NPC central conduit. The model explicitly takes into account inter- and intramolecular interactions, as well as the finite size of the NTRs (∼20{\%} of the NPC channel diameter). It reproduces various proposed scenarios for the channel structure, ranging from a central polymer condensate (selective phase) to brushlike polymer arrangements localized at the channel wall (virtual gate, reduction of dimensionality), with the transport receptors lining the polymer surface. In addition, it predicts a new structure in which NTRs become an integral part of the transport barrier by forming a cross-linked network with the unstructured proteins stretching across the pore. The model provides specific and distinctive predictions for the equilibrium spatial distributions of NTRs for these different scenarios that can be experimentally verified by, e.g., superresolution fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, it suggests mechanisms by which globular macromolecules (colloidal particles) can cause polymer-coated nanopores to switch between open and closed configurations, a possible explanation of the biological function of the NPC, and suggests potential technological applications for filtration and single-molecule sensing.},

abstract = {The limiting conditional probability distribution (LCD) has been much studied in the field of mathematical biology, particularly in the context of epidemiology and the persistence of epidemics. However, it has not yet been applied to the immune system. One of the characteristic features of the T cell repertoire is its diversity. This diversity declines in old age, whence the concepts of extinction and persistence are also relevant to the immune system. In this paper we model T cell repertoire maintenance by means of a continuous-time birth and death process on the positive integers, where the origin is an absorbing state. We show that eventual extinction is guaranteed. The late-time behaviour of the process before extinction takes place is modelled by the LCD, which we prove always exists for the process studied here. In most cases, analytic expressions for the LCD cannot be computed but the probability distribution may be approximated by means of the stationary probability distributions of two related processes. We show how these approximations are related to the LCD of the original process and use them to study the LCD in two special cases. We also make use of the large N expansion to derive a further approximation to the LCD. The accuracy of the various approximations is then analysed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We are interested in the long time behavior of a two-type density-dependent biological population conditioned on non-extinction, in both cases of competition or weak cooperation between the two species. This population is described by a stochastic Lotka-Volterra system, obtained as limit of renormalized interacting birth and death processes. The weak cooperation assumption allows the system not to blow up. We study the existence and uniqueness of a quasi-stationary distribution, that is convergence to equilibrium conditioned on non-extinction. To this aim we generalize in two-dimensions spectral tools developed for one-dimensional generalized Feller diffusion processes. The existence proof of a quasi-stationary distribution is reduced to the one for a d-dimensional Kolmogorov diffusion process under a symmetry assumption. The symmetry we need is satisfied under a local balance condition relying the ecological rates. A novelty is the outlined relation between the uniqueness of the quasi-stationary distribution and the ultracontractivity of the killed semi-group. By a comparison between the killing rates for the populations of each type and the one of the global population, we show that the quasi-stationary distribution can be either supported by individuals of one (the strongest one) type or supported by individuals of the two types. We thus highlight two different long time behaviors depending on the parameters of the model: either the model exhibits an intermediary time scale for which only one type (the dominant trait) is surviving, or there is a positive probability to have coexistence of the two species.},

abstract = {Abstract.—Harsh conditions (e.g., mortality and stress) reduce population growth rates directly; secondarily, they may reduce the intensity of interactions between organisms. Near-exclusive fo- cus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of even ecologically very similar species. By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interac- tions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctua- tions create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. We argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most commonly found in ecological models. Such considerations imply strong roles for species interactions in the diversity of a community.},

abstract = {The increasing use of computer simulation by theoretical ecologists started a move away from models formulated at the population level towards individual-based models. However, many of the models studied at the individual level are not analysed mathematically and remain defined in terms of a computer algorithm. This is not surprising, given that they are intrinsically stochastic and require tools and techniques for their study that may be unfamiliar to ecologists. Here, we argue that the construction of ecological models at the individual level and their subsequent analysis is, in many cases, straightforward and leads to important insights. We discuss recent work that highlights the importance of stochastic effects for parameter ranges and systems where it was previously thought that such effects would be negligible. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mutualisms between species play an important role in ecosystemfunction and stability. However, in some environments, the competitive aspects of an interactionmay dominate themutualistic aspects. Although these transitions could have far-reaching implications, it has been difficult to study the causes and consequences of this mutualistic–competitive transition in experimentally tractable systems. Here, we study amicrobial cross-feeding mutualism in which each yeast strain supplies an essential amino acid for its partner strain. We find that, depending upon the amount of freely available amino acid in the environ- ment, this pair of strains can exhibit an obligatorymutualism, facultativemutualism, com- petition, parasitism, competitive exclusion, or failedmutualism leading to extinction of the population. A simplemodel capturing the essential features of this interaction explains how resource availabilitymodulates the interaction and predicts that changes in the dynamics of the mutualism in deteriorating environments can provide advance warning that collapse of the mutualism is imminent.We confirmthis prediction experimentally by showing that, in the high nutrient competitive regime, the strains rapidly reach a common carrying capacity before slowly reaching the equilibrium ratio between the strains. How- ever, in the low nutrient regime, before collapse of the obligatemutualism, we find that the ratio rapidly reaches its equilibrium and it is the total abundance that is slow to reach equilibrium.Our results provide a general framework for how mutualisms may transition between qualitatively different regimes of interaction in response to changes in nutrient availability in the environment.},

abstract = {We present here a self-contained analytic review of the role of stochastic factors acting on a virus population. We develop a simple one-locus, two-allele model of a haploid population of constant size including the factors of random drift, purifying selection, and random mutation. We consider different virological experiments: accumulation and reversion of deleterious mutations, competition between mutant and wild-type viruses, gene fixation, mutation frequencies at the steady state, divergence of two populations split from one population, and genetic turnover within a single population. In the first part of the review, we present all principal results in qualitative terms and illustrate them with examples obtained by computer simulation. In the second part, we derive the results formally from a diffusion equation of the Wright-Fisher type and boundary conditions, all derived from the first principles for the virus population model. We show that the leading factors and observable behavior of evolution differ significantly in three broad intervals of population size, N. The "neutral limit" is reached when N is smaller than the inverse selection coefficient. When N is larger than the inverse mutation rate per base, selection dominates and evolution is "almost" deterministic. If the selection coefficient is much larger than the mutation rate, there exists a broad interval of population sizes, in which weakly diverse populations are almost neutral while highly diverse populations are controlled by selection pressure. We discuss in detail the application of our results to human immunodeficiency virus population in vivo, sampling effects, and limitations of the model.},

Our mathematical framework shows that habitat fluctuations are sufficient for explaining intra-bodysite correlations in relative species abundances from the Human Microbiome Project. We explicitly show that the relative abundances of phylogenetically related species are positively correlated and can be predicted from taxonomic relationships. We identify a small set of functional pathways related to metabolism and maintenance of the cell wall that form the basis of a common resource sharing niche space of the human microbiota.},

"To put it another way, the relative abundances of related species are highly correlated because they have similar resource requirements. This is true even though species that use similar resources are competing with each other. The intuition derived from dynamical models that the abundances of competing species should be anti-correlated simply does not apply when the habitat conditions are highly variable."

due to horizontal gene transfer, taxonomy is unrelated to ecological activity [24-27], but the results of this paper imply ecologically derived constraints on evolution

abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

We hypothesized that bacterium-bacterium antagonistic interactions may contribute to variations in community structure at the microscale. We examined each of the 86 isolates for their inhibition of growth of the remaining 85 isolates by the Burkholder agar diffusion assay. More than one-half of the isolates expressed antagonistic activity, and this trait was more common with particle-associated bacteria than with free-living bacteria. This was exemplified by members of the alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria (alpha-proteobacteria), in which production of antagonistic molecules was dominated by attached bacteria. We found that gamma-proteobacteria (members of the orders Alteromonadales and Vibrionales) are the most prolific producers of inhibitory materials and also the most resilient to them, while members of the Bacteriodetes were the organisms that were least productive and most sensitive to antagonistic interactions. Widespread interspecies growth inhibition is consistent with the role of this phenomenon in structuring bacterial communities at the microscale. Furthermore, our results suggest that bacteria from pelagic marine particles may be an underutilized source of novel antibiotics.},

abstract = {Bacteria have fascinating and diverse social lives. They display coordinated group behaviors regulated by quorum-sensing systems that detect the density of other bacteria around them. A key example of such group behavior is biofilm formation, in which communities of cells attach to a surface and envelope themselves in secreted polymers. Curiously, after reaching high cell density, some bacterial species activate polymer secretion, whereas others terminate polymer secretion. Here, we investigate this striking variation in the first evolutionary model of quorum sensing in biofilms. We use detailed individual-based simulations to investigate evolutionary competitions between strains that differ in their polymer production and quorum-sensing phenotypes. The benefit of activating polymer secretion at high cell density is relatively straightforward: secretion starts upon biofilm formation, allowing strains to push their lineages into nutrient-rich areas and suffocate neighboring cells. But why use quorum sensing to terminate polymer secretion at high cell density? We find that deactivating polymer production in biofilms can yield an advantage by redirecting resources into growth, but that this advantage occurs only in a limited time window. We predict, therefore, that down-regulation of polymer secretion at high cell density will evolve when it can coincide with dispersal events, but it will be disfavored in long-lived (chronic) biofilms with sustained competition among strains. Our model suggests that the observed variation in quorum-sensing behavior can be linked to the differing requirements of bacteria in chronic versus acute biofilm infections. This is well illustrated by the case of Vibrio cholerae, which competes within biofilms by polymer secretion, terminates polymer secretion at high cell density, and induces an acute disease course that ends with mass dispersal from the host. More generally, this work shows that the balance of competition within and among biofilms can be pivotal in the evolution of quorum sensing.},

abstract = {Cooperative phenotypes are considered central to the functioning of microbial communities in many contexts, including communication via quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenesis. The human intestine houses a dense and diverse microbial community critical to health, yet we know little about cooperation within this important ecosystem. Here we test experimentally for evolved cooperation within the Bacteroidales, the dominant Gram-negative bacteria of the human intestine. We show that during growth on certain dietary polysaccharides, the model member Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron exhibits only limited cooperation. Although this organism digests these polysaccharides extracellularly, mutants lacking this ability are outcompeted. In contrast, we discovered a dedicated cross-feeding enzyme system in the prominent gut symbiont Bacteroides ovatus, which digests polysaccharide at a cost to itself but at a benefit to another species. Using in vitro systems and gnotobiotic mouse colonization models, we find that extracellular digestion of inulin increases the fitness of B. ovatus owing to reciprocal benefits when it feeds other gut species such as Bacteroides vulgatus. This is a rare example of naturally-evolved cooperation between microbial species. Our study reveals both the complexity and importance of cooperative phenotypes within the mammalian intestinal microbiota.},

abstract = {Statistical fluctuations limit the precision with which a microorganism can, in a given time T, determine the concentration of a chemoattractant in the surrounding medium. The best a cell can do is to monitor continually the state of occupation of receptors distributed over its surface. For nearly optimum performance only a small fraction of the surface need be specifically adsorbing. The probability that a molecule that has collided with the cell will find a receptor is Ns/(Ns + pi a), if N receptors, each with a binding site of radius s, are evenly distributed over a cell of radius a. There is ample room for many indenpendent systems of specific receptors. The adsorption rate for molecules of moderate size cannot be significantly enhanced by motion of the cell or by stirring of the medium by the cell. The least fractional error attainable in the determination of a concentration c is approximately (TcaD) - 1/2, where D is diffusion constant of the attractant. The number of specific receptors needed to attain such precision is about a/s. Data on bacteriophage absorption, bacterial chemotaxis, and chemotaxis in a cellular slime mold are evaluated. The chemotactic sensitivity of Escherichia coli approaches that of the cell of optimum design.},

abstract = {Given a discrete stochastic process, for example a chemical reaction system or a birth and death process, we often want to find a continuous stochastic approximation so that the techniques of stochastic differential equations may be brought to bear. One powerful and useful way to do this is the system size expansion of van Kampen to express a trajectory as a small stochastic perturbation to a deterministic trajectory, using a small parameter related to the volume of the system in question. This is usually pursued only up to first order, called the Linear Noise Approximation. The usual derivation of this proceeds via the master equation of the discrete process and derives a Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic perturbation, both of which are equations for the evolution of probability distributions. Here we present a derivation using stochastic difference equations for the discrete process and leading, via the chemical Langevin equation of Gillespie, directly to a stochastic differential equation for the stochastic perturbation. The new derivation, which does not yield the full system size expansion, draws more explicitly on the intuition of ordinary differential equations so may be more easily digestible for some audiences.},

abstract = {When beneficial mutations are rare, they accumulate by a series of selective sweeps. But when they are common, many beneficial mutations will occur before any can fix, so there will be many different mutant lineages in the population concurrently. In an asexual population, these different mutant lineages interfere and not all can fix simultaneously. In addition, further beneficial mutations can accumulate in mutant lineages while these are still a minority of the population. In this article, we analyze the dynamics of such multiple mutations and the interplay between multiple mutations and interference between clones. These result in substantial variation in fitness accumulating within a single asexual population. The amount of variation is determined by a balance between selection, which destroys variation, and beneficial mutations, which create more. The behavior depends in a subtle way on the population parameters: the population size, the beneficial mutation rate, and the distribution of the fitness increments of the potential beneficial mutations. The mutation-selection balance leads to a continually evolving population with a steady-state fitness variation. This variation increases logarithmically with both population size and mutation rate and sets the rate at which the population accumulates beneficial mutations, which thus also grows only logarithmically with population size and mutation rate. These results imply that mutator phenotypes are less effective in larger asexual populations. They also have consequences for the advantages (or disadvantages) of sex via the Fisher-Muller effect; these are discussed briefly.},

A synthetic network exhibiting oscillatory behavior has recently been constructed [Elowitz, M. B. {\&} Leibler, S. (2000) Nature (London) 403, 335-338]. It has also been shown that a natural bacterial quorum-sensing mechanism can be used in a synthetic system to communicate a signal between two populations of cells, such that receipt of the signal causes expression of a target gene [Weiss, R. {\&} Knight, T. F. (2000) in DNA6: Sixth International Meeting on DNA-Based Computers, June 13-17, 2000, Leiden, The Netherlands]. We propose a synthetic gene network in Escherichia coli which combines these two features: the system acts as a relaxation oscillator and uses an intercell signaling mechanism to couple the oscillators and induce synchronous oscillations. We model the system and show that the proposed coupling scheme does lead to synchronous behavior across a population of cells. We provide an analytical treatment of the synchronization process, the dominant mechanism of which is "fast threshold modulation."},

It was pointed out by us recently that this 1D linear translocation model is equivalent to the one that was considered by Schr{\"{o}}dinger for the Ehrenhaft-Millikan measurements on electron charge. Here, we apply Schr{\"{o}}dinger's first-passage-time distribution formula to the data set in Li and Talaga. It is found that Schr{\"{o}}dinger's formula can be used to describe the time distribution of DNA translocation in solid-state nanopores. These fittings yield two useful parameters: the drift velocity of DNA translocation and the diffusion constant of DNA inside the nanopore. The results suggest two regimes of DNA translocation: (I) at low voltages, there are clear deviations from Smoluchowski's linear law of electrophoresis, which we attribute to the entropic barrier effects; (II) at high voltages, the translocation velocity is a linear function of the applied electric field. In regime II, the apparent diffusion constant exhibits a quadratic dependence on the applied electric field, suggesting a mechanism of Taylor-dispersion effect likely due the electro-osmotic flow field in the nanopore channel. This analysis yields a dispersion-free diffusion constant value of 11.2 nm(2) {\$}\mu{\$}s(-1) for the segment of DNA inside the nanopore, which is in quantitative agreement with the Stokes-Einstein theory.

We argue that combining mechanistic theory with theoretical ecology and evolution provides a key strategy for clarifying how cell groups form, how they change in composition over time, and how they interact with their environments. Here, we review concepts that are critical for dissecting the complexity of cell collectives, including dimensionless parameter groups, individual-based modelling and evolutionary theory.

Crucial mediators of Xenopus oocyte maturation, includ- ing the p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the cell-division cycle protein kinase Cdc2, are known to be orga- nized into positive feedback loops3 . In principle, such positive feedback loops could produce an actively maintained ‘memory' of a transient inductive stimulus and could explain the irrever- sibility of maturation3–6 . Here we show that the p42 MAPK and Cdc2 system normally generates an irreversible biochemical response from a transient stimulus, but the response becomes transient when positive feedback is blocked. Our results explain how a group of intrinsically reversible signal transducers can generate an irreversible response at a systems level, and show how a cell fate can be maintained by a self-sustaining pattern of protein kinase activation.},

It is difficult to answer definitively because we have so many (at least 120) plausible hypotheses. This abundance of hypotheses has led to a number of attempts to classify them. Unfortunately, richness hypotheses often defy such categorization. Instead of placing species richness hypotheses into categories, I suggest an alternative approach: to treat species richness hypotheses as violations of the assumptions of Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle. This is a very similar approach to the pedagogy of population genetics: evolution occurs if and only if at least one assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg principle is violated. The classification of hypotheses advocated here treats interspecific competition as a central organizing concept in community theory. However, it does not treat competition as an organizing concept in communities: indeed, the relaxation or disruption of competition is considered to be the status quo in the majority of communities.},

abstract = {Many parasites induce powerful immune defense mechanisms when they infect a vertebrate host. The vertebrate immune response can be roughly divided into nonspecific immunity, which can recognize relatively few parasites but can respond rapidly, and specific immunity, which can recognize many parasites but is slower to respond. The inverse relationship between the speed and the specificity of the response arises from the way in which the receptors used to recognize parasites are arranged in an immune cell population. Different effector mechanisms are induced against different parasites. The way in which nonspecific and specific immunity ‘decide' on which effectors to use also differs as a consequence of the different arrangement of receptors on nonspecific and specific cells. The combined use of nonspecific and specific immunity provides the ‘best of both worlds' in terms of mounting rapid, powerful, appropriate responses to many parasites. Inducibility of the immune response may be important in reducing energy costs and immunopathology, but may be more important in allowing the magnitude of the immune response to change depending on the size of the parasite population. If the immune system can also discriminate between different parasites, then inducibility also allows the immune system to fine tune effector mechanisms to each type of parasite. The ability of the immune system to respond to the size and type of parasite on a timescale similar to the turnover of parasites is central to the ability of vertebrates to overcome parasites despite potentially rapid parasite replication and evolution. The specificity of recognition of parasites by the immune system, which is central to the speed and type of response induced by different parasites, varies tremendously between host species. Whilst the energetic costs involved in expanding individual clones of specific immune cells may be important in limiting specificity, the need to have a functional immune repertoire early in life and/or the need to mount rapid responses when a 3 parasite infects may be more important, due to the inverse relationship between speed and specificity.},

abstract = {The contribution of the low-energy excited states to the overall product formation in the radiolysis of simple aromatic liquids-benzene, pyridine, toluene, and aniline-has been examined by comparison of product yields obtained in UV-photolysis and in {\$}\gamma{\$}-radiolysis. In photolysis, these electronic excited states were selectively populated using UV-light excitation sources with various energies. Yields of molecular hydrogen and of "dimers" (biphenyl, bibenzyl, dipyridyl for benzene, toluene, pyridine, respectively, and of ammonia and diphenylamine for aniline) have been determined, since they are the most abundant radiolytic products. Negligibly small production of molecular hydrogen in the UV-photolysis of aromatic liquids with excitation to energies of 4.88, 5.41, 5.79, and 6.70 eV and the lack of a scavenger effect suggest that this product originates from short-lived high-energy singlet states. A significant reduction in "dimer" radiation-chemical yields in the presence of scavengers such as anthracene or naphthalene indicates that the triplet excited states are important precursors to these products. The results for toluene and aniline suggest that efficient dissociation from the lowest-energy excited triplet state leads to noticeable "dimer" production. For benzene and pyridine, the lowest-energy triplet excited states are not likely to fragment into radicals because of the relatively large energy gap between the excited state level and corresponding bond dissociation energy. The "dimer" formation in the radiolysis of benzene and pyridine is likely to involve short-lived high-energy triplet states.},

Using a field experiment focusing on a system of Mediterranean grasslands, we show that interspecific competition may influence the two components in the same direction or in opposite directions, depending on whether competitive exclusions are deterministic or stochastic. Deterministic exclusions reduce both patch-scale richness and beta-diversity, thereby homogenising the community. Stochastic extinctions reduce richness at the patch scale, but increase the differences in species composition among patches. These results indicate that studies of competitive effects on beta diversity may help to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic components of competitive exclusion. Such distinction is crucial for understanding the causal relationship between competition and species diversity, one of the oldest and most fundamental questions in ecology.},

abstract = {Though many processes are involved in determining which species coexist and assemble into communities, competition is among the best studied. One hypothesis about competition{\~{O}}s contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to refine expectations for how species relatedness influences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.},

abstract = {In plankton ecology, it is a fundamental question as to how a large number of competing phytoplankton species coexist in marine ecosystems under a seemingly-limited variety of resources. This ever-green question was first proposed by Hutchinson [Hutchinson, G.E., 1961. The paradox of the plankton. Am. Nat. 95, 137-145] as 'the paradox of the plankton'. Starting from Hutchinson [Hutchinson, G.E., 1961. The paradox of the plankton. Am. Nat. 95, 137-145], over more than four decades several investigators have put forward varieties of mechanisms for the extreme diversity of phytoplankton species. In this article, within the boundary of our knowledge, we review the literature of the proposed solutions and give a brief overview of the mechanisms proposed so far. The proposed mechanisms that we discuss mainly include spatial and temporal heterogeneity in physical and biological environment, externally imposed or self-generated spatial segregation, horizontal mesoscale turbulence of ocean characterized by coherent vortices, oscillation and chaos generated by several internal and external causes, stable coexistence and compensatory dynamics under fluctuating temperature in resource competition, and finally the role of toxin-producing phytoplankton in maintaining the coexistence and biodiversity of the overall plankton population that we have proposed recently. We find that, although the different mechanisms proposed so far is potentially applicable to specific ecosystems, a universally accepted theory for explaining plankton diversity in natural waters is still an unachieved goal. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Frequency-dependent selection and demographic fluctuations play important roles in evolutionary and ecological processes. Under frequency-dependent selection, the average fitness of the population may increase or decrease based on interactions between individuals within the population. This should be reflected in fluctuations of the population size even in constant environments. Here, we propose a stochastic model that naturally combines these two evolutionary ingredients by assuming frequency-dependent competition between different types in an individual-based model. In contrast to previous game theoretic models, the carrying capacity of the population, and thus the population size, is determined by pairwise competition of individuals mediated by evolutionary games and demographic stochasticity. In the limit of infinite population size, the averaged stochastic dynamics is captured by deterministic competitive Lotka– Volterra equations. In small populations, demographic stochasticity may instead lead to the extinction of the entire population. Because the population size is driven by fitness in evolutionary games, a population of cooperators is less prone to go extinct than a population of defectors, whereas in the usual systems of fixed size the population would thrive regardless of its average payoff.},

Studies on ecosystem function are traditionally focused on changes in species composition. However, this species-centric approach neglects the often dramatic changes in the ecology of organisms during their development, thereby limiting our ability to link the structure of populations and communities to the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the impact of organisms on community structure and ecosystem processes often differ more among developmental stages within a species than between species, contrary to current assumptions. Importantly, we show that functional differences between species vary depending on the specific demographic structure of predators. One important implication is that changes in the demography of populations can strongly alter the functional composition of communities and change ecosystem processes long before any species are extirpated from communities.},

The motivation is that evolutionary inferences are often made from phylogenetic trees reconstructed from population data even though recombination may well occur (mtDNA or viral sequences) or does occur (nuclear sequences). We investigate the size and direction of biases when a single tree is reconstructed ignoring recombination. Standard software (PHYLIP) was used to construct the best phylogenetic tree from sequences simulated under the coalescent with recombination. With recombination present, the length of terminal branches and the total branch length are larger, and the time to the most recent common ancestor smaller, than for a tree reconstructed from sequences evolving with no recombination. The effects are pronounced even for small levels of recombination that may not be immediately detectable in a data set. The phylogenies when recombination is present superficially resemble phylogenies for sequences from an exponentially growing population. However, exponential growth has a different effect on statistics such as Tajima's D. Furthermore, ignoring recombination leads to a large overestimation of the substitution rate heterogeneity and the loss of the molecular clock. These results are discussed in relation to viral and mtDNA data sets.},

Two factors are shown to determine the fitness of a strain: adaptive epitope changes and deleterious mutations outside the epitopes. We infer both fitness components for the strains circulating in a given year, using population-genetic data of all previous strains. From fitness and frequency of each strain, we predict the frequency of its descendent strains in the following year. This fitness model maps the adaptive history of influenza A and suggests a principled method for vaccine selection.

abstract = {Recognition of pathogens relies on families of proteins showing great diversity. Here we construct maximum entropy models of the sequence repertoire, building on recent experiments that provide a nearly exhaustive sampling of the IgM sequences in zebrafish. These models are based solely on pairwise correlations between residue positions but correctly capture the higher order statistical properties of the repertoire. By exploiting the interpretation of these models as statistical physics problems, we make several predictions for the collective properties of the sequence ensemble: The distribution of sequences obeys Zipf's law, the repertoire decomposes into several clusters, and there is a massive restriction of diversity because of the correlations. These predictions are completely inconsistent with models in which amino acid substitutions are made independently at each site and are in good agreement with the data. Our results suggest that antibody diversity is not limited by the sequences encoded in the genome and may reflect rapid adaptation to antigenic challenges. This approach should be applicable to the study of the global properties of other protein families.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are sensitive to so-called adversarial perturbations. This is reminiscent of cellular decision-making where antagonist ligands may prevent correct signaling, like during the early immune response. We draw a formal analogy between neural networks used in machine learning and the general class of adaptive proofreading networks. We then apply simple adversarial strategies from machine learning to models of ligand discrimination. We show how kinetic proofreading leads to "boundary tilting" and identify three types of perturbation (adversarial, non adversarial and ambiguous). We then use a gradient-descent approach to compare different adaptive proofreading models, and we reveal the existence of two qualitatively different regimes characterized by the presence or absence of a critical point. These regimes are reminiscent of the "feature-to-prototype" transition identified in machine learning, corresponding to two strategies in ligand antagonism (broad vs. specialized). Overall, our work connects evolved cellular decision-making to classification in machine learning, showing that behaviours close to the decision boundary can be understood through the same mechanisms.},

abstract = {Biological cells are able to accurately sense chemicals with receptors at their surfaces, allowing cells to move towards sources of attractant and away from sources of repellent. The accuracy of sensing chemical concentration is ultimately limited by the random arrival of particles at the receptors by diffusion. This fundamental physical limit is generally considered to be the Berg {\&} Purcell limit [H.C. Berg and E.M. Purcell, Biophys. J. {\{}$\backslash$bf 20{\}}, 193 (1977)]. Here we derive a lower limit by applying maximum likelihood to the time series of receptor occupancy. The increased accuracy stems from solely considering the unoccupied time intervals - disregarding the occupied time intervals as these do not contain any information about the external particle concentration, and only decrease the accuracy of the concentration estimate. Receptors which minimize the bound time intervals achieve the highest possible accuracy. We discuss how a cell could implement such an optimal sensing strategy by absorbing or degrading bound particles.},

We investigate the feasibility of using a surrogate-based method to emulate the deformation and detachment behaviour of a biofilm in response to hydrodynamic shear stress. The influence of shear force, growth rate and viscoelastic parameters on the patterns of growth, structure and resulting shape of microbial biofilms was examined. We develop a statistical modelling approach to this problem, using combination of Bayesian Poisson regression and dynamic linear models for the emulation. We observe that the hydrodynamic shear force affects biofilm deformation in line with some literature. Sensitivity results also showed that the expected number of shear events, shear flow, yield coefficient for heterotrophic bacteria and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) stiffness per unit EPS mass are the four principal mechanisms governing the bacteria detachment in this study. The sensitivity of the model parameters is temporally dynamic, emphasising the significance of conducting the sensitivity analysis across multiple time points. The surrogate models are shown to perform well, and produced 480 fold increase in computational efficiency. We conclude that a surrogate-based approach is effective, and resulting biofilm structure is determined primarily by a balance between bacteria growth, viscoelastic parameters and applied shear stress.},

This article reviews and summarizes the numerical studies performed in this area including conventional numerical methods as well as the new Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). Most of these computational simulations are in acceptable concordance with the results from experiments. However, there are some challenges to encounter when dealing with nanofluids.

We start with a delineation of the scales characterizing the behavior of the nanoparticle/host fluid system. Asymptotic expansions, multiple time and space scale techniques, the resulting coarse-grained dynamics of the probability densities of the Fokker-Planck-Chandrasekhar (FPC) type for the nanoparticle(s), and the hydrodynamic models of the host medium are obtained. Collections of nanoparticles are considered so that problems such as viral self-assembly and the transition from a particle suspension to a solid porous matrix can be addressed via a deductive approach that starts with the Liouville equation and a calibrated atomic force field, and yields a generalized FPC equation. Extensions allowing for the investigation of the rotation and deformation of the nanoparticles are considered in the context of the space-warping formalism. Thermodynamic forces and dissipative effects are accounted for. The notion of configuration-dependent drag coefficients and their implications for coagulation and consolidation are shown to be natural consequences of the analysis. All results are obtained via formal asymptotic expansions in mass, size, and other physical and kinetic parameter ratios.},

Viral load is important as a driver of the immune response to the viral infection and in determining the infectiousness of an infected individual. However in many cases when examining the immune response or spread of infection, it may be sufficient to have a more parsimonious model of viral load than the detailed kinetic models. Here we review properties of detailed kinetic models of Influenza A virus and discuss the use of a logistic growth model to approximate viral load. We make application of the tools of identifiability analysis and model selection to assess the logistic growth model as a proxy for viral load. We find that the parameters of the logistic growth model can be related to the parameters of a detailed viral kinetic model, the logistic growth model makes a strong fit to viral load data with a small number of parameters, and that these parameters can be reliably identified from viral load data generated by a detailed kinetic model.},

abstract = {The stochastic versions of the logistic and extended logistic growth models are applied successfully to explain many real-life population dynamics and share a central body of literature in stochastic modeling of ecological systems. To understand the randomness in the population dynamics of the underlying processes completely, it is important to have a clear idea about the quasi-equilibrium distribution and its moments. Bartlett et al. (1960) took a pioneering attempt for estimating the moments of the quasi-equilibrium distribution of the stochastic logistic model. Matis and Kiffe (1996) obtain a set of more accurate and elegant approximations for the mean, variance and skewness of the quasi-equilibrium distribution of the same model using cumulant truncation method. The method is extended for stochastic power law logistic family by the same and several other authors (N. a˙sell, 2003; Singh and Hespanha, 2007). Cumulant truncation and some alternative methods e.g. saddle point approximation, derivative matching approach can be applied if the powers involved in the extended logistic set up are integers, although plenty of evidence is available for non-integer powers in many practical situations (Sibly et al., 2005). In this paper, we develop a set of new approximations for mean, variance and skewness of the quasi-equilibrium distribution under more general family of growth curves, which is applicable for both integer and non-integer powers. The deterministic counterpart of this family of models captures both monotonic and non-monotonic behavior of the per capita growth rate, of which theta-logistic is a special case. The approximations accurately estimate the first three order moments of the quasi-equilibrium distribution. The proposed method is illustrated with simulated data and real data from global population dynamics database.},

Decision making about investments into emerging technologies and strategic planning activities also rely upon consistent forecasts of technological substitution. There is a long record of applying different extrapolation techniques and, in particular, the logistic growth curves (S-curves) for studies about future changes. However, inappropriate use of S-shaped curves often leads to strange and inadequate results. Thus, among others, it is important to well define the system to forecast and provide an interpretable model from data. The paper illustrates the use of single logistic curve and logistic component analysis focusing on the coherence be- tween model, data and interpretation. Directions for improving these techniques are discussed and a process for un- ambiguous definition of system is introduced.},

The models are characterized by their non-sigmoidal shape and are based on three assumptions: quantity of growth machinery works at a rate dependent on feed intake; the relationship between growth rate and intake level follows the law of diminishing returns; and growth is irreversible. The Michaelis–Menten and Mitscherlich equations are used in their formulation. To investigate their potential, the models were fitted to six datasets, representing repeated measures of live body weights of two species: rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The models were evaluated on the basis of fitting behaviour, examination of residuals, along with measures of goodness-of-fit. Agreement between predicted and observed body weights, and flexibility to mimic growth patterns given varying species and culture conditions, affirm the ability of both models to describe indeterminate growth in fish.},

abstract = {The Akzo Nobel research laboratories formulated this problem in their study of the penetration of radio-labeled antibodies into a tissue that has been infected by a tumor. This study was carried out for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. The treatment of malignant diseases, after its primary treatment by surgery, is either by external beam radiotherapy, which is effective but local, or by chemotherapy, which is effective but not selective. The radiotherapy labelled antibody has to be able to penetrate the whole of the tumour, whereas for imaging only uptake on the surface of the tumour is needed. Factors such as dose, rate delivered, tumor size, and radiosensitivity play a major role in determining therapeutic response, while target-to-nontarget ratios and, particularly, circulating radioactivity to the bone marrow determine the major dose-limiting toxicities. In this article, we introduced a system of differential equations with small parameter with applications in radioimmunotherapy. The problem consists of two partial differential equations. Both the equation of this system includes small parameter epsilon. We introduce the mathematical technique known as boundary function method for singular perturbation system. In this system, the small parameter is an asymptotic variable, different from the independent variable. We write solution of this system in a small parameter, and investigation of asymptotic solution for system. Using the program Matlab and numerical method Runge-Kutta, I did various simulations for different values of biological parameters presented in the model studied.},

As a consequence, cancer cells have distinctive motility and mechanical properties, which are important for many processes, including invasion and metastasis. Here, we studied the effects of actin cytoskeleton alterations induced by specific nucleation inhibitors (SMIFH2, CK-666), cytochalasin D, Y-27632 and detachment from the surface by trypsinization on the mechanical properties of normal Vero and prostate cancer cell line DU145. The Young's modulus of Vero cells was 1300. ±. 900. Pa, while the prostate cancer cell line DU145 exhibited significantly lower Young's moduli (600. ±. 400. Pa). The Young's moduli exhibited a log-normal distribution for both cell lines. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells demonstrated diverse viscoelastic behavior and different responses to actin cytoskeleton reorganization. They were more resistant to specific formin-dependent nucleation inhibition, and reinforced their cortical actin after detachment from the substrate.

abstract = {Actin filament dynamics have been studied for decades in pure protein solutions or in cell extracts, but a breakthrough in the field occurred at the turn of the century when it became possible to reconstitute networks of actin filaments, growing in a controlled but physiological manner on surfaces, mimicking the actin assembly that occurs at the plasma membrane during cell protrusion and cell shape changes. The story begins with the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, the study of which led to the reconstitution of cellular actin polymerization on a variety of supports including plastic beads. These studies made possible the development of liposome-type substrates for filament assembly and micropatterning of actin polymerization nucleation. Based on the accumulated expertise of the last 15. years, many exciting approaches are being developed, including the addition of myosin to biomimetic actin networks to study the interplay between actin structure and contractility. The field is now poised to make artificial cells with a physiological and dynamic actin cytoskeleton, and subsequently to put these cells together to make in vitro tissues.

IFs are hierarchical structures and their physical properties seem to a large part be encoded in the very specific architecture of the biopolymers.

This review critically reflects the emerging molecular mechanism of lipid-driven endocytosis and the impact of model membrane systems in elucidating the complex interplay of biomolecules within this process. Lipid receptor clustering induced by binding of several toxins, viruses and bacteria to the plasma membrane leads to local membrane bending and formation of tubular membrane invaginations. Here, lipid shape, and protein structure and valency are the essential parameters in membrane deformation. Combining observations of complex cellular processes and their reconstitution on minimal systems seems to be a promising future approach to resolve basic underlying mechanisms.

Recent advances in high-resolution live-cell imaging and single-cell force measurement have dramatically sharpened our understanding of the assembly, connectivity, and evolution of various specialized stress fiber subpopulations. This in turn has motivated interest in understanding how individual stress fibers generate tension and support cellular structure and force generation. In this review, we discuss approaches for measuring the mechanical properties of single stress fibers. We begin by discussing studies conducted in cell-free settings, including strategies based on isolation of intact stress fibers and reconstitution of stress fiber-like structures from purified components. We then discuss measurements obtained in living cells based both on inference of stress fiber properties from whole-cell mechanical measurements (e.g., atomic force microscopy) and on direct interrogation of single stress fibers (e.g., subcellular laser nanosurgery). We conclude by reviewing various mathematical models of stress fiber function that have been developed based on these experimental measurements. An important future challenge in this area will be the integration of these sophisticated biophysical measurements with the field's increasingly detailed molecular understanding of stress fiber assembly, dynamics, and signal transduction.

abstract = {Many soft materials are classified as viscoelastic. They behave mechanically neither quite fluid-like nor quite solid-like - rather a bit of both. Biomaterials are often said to fall into this class. Here, we argue that this misses a crucial aspect, and that biomechanics is essentially damage mechanics, at heart. When deforming an animal cell or tissue, one can hardly avoid inducing the unfolding of protein domains, the unbinding of cytoskeletal crosslinkers, the breaking of weak sacrificial bonds, and the disruption of transient adhesions. We classify these activated structural changes as inelastic. They are often to a large degree reversible and are therefore not plastic in the proper sense, but they dissipate substantial amounts of elastic energy by structural damping. We review recent experiments involving biological materials on all scales, from single biopolymers over cells to model tissues, to illustrate the unifying power of this paradigm. A deliberately minimalistic yet phenomenologically very rich mathematical modeling framework for inelastic biomechanics is proposed. It transcends the conventional viscoelastic paradigm and suggests itself as a promising candidate for a unified description and interpretation of a wide range of experimental data.

abstract = {Mechanotransduction refers to the processes through which cells sense mechanical stimuli by converting them to biochemical signals and, thus, eliciting specific cellular responses. Cells sense mechanical stimuli from their 3D environment, including the extracellular matrix, neighboring cells and other mechanical forces. Incidentally, the emerging concept of mechanical homeostasis,long term or chronic regulation of mechanical properties, seems to apply to neutrophils in a peculiar manner, owing to neutrophils' ability to dynamically switch between the activated/primed and deactivated/deprimed states. While neutrophil activation has been known for over a century, its deactivation is a relatively recent discovery. Even more intriguing is the reversibility of neutrophil activation and deactivation. We review and critically evaluate recent findings that suggest physiological roles for neutrophil activation and deactivation and discuss possible mechanisms by which mechanical stimuli can drive the oscillation of neutrophils between the activated and resting states. We highlight several molecules that have been identified in neutrophil mechanotransduction, including cell adhesion and transmembrane receptors, cytoskeletal and ion channel molecules. The physiological and pathophysiological implications of such mechanically induced signal transduction in neutrophils are highlighted as a basis for future work.

abstract = {Living cells are active mechanical systems that are able to generate forces. Their structure and shape are primarily determined by biopolymer filaments and molecular motors that form the cytoskeleton. Active force generation requires constant consumption of energy to maintain the nonequilibrium activity to drive organization and transport processes necessary for their function. To understand this activity it is necessary to develop new approaches to probe the underlying physical processes. Active cell mechanics incorporates active molecular-scale force generation into the traditional framework of mechanics of materials. This review highlights recent experimental and theoretical developments towards understanding active cell mechanics. We focus primarily on intracellular mechanical measurements and theoretical advances utilizing the Langevin framework. These developing approaches allow a quantitative understanding of nonequilibrium mechanical activity in living cells. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mechanobiology.},

Here we review the basic principles and different variants of this approach. In general, the extraction of the substrate displacement field from image data and the reconstruction procedure for the forces are closely linked to each other and limited by the presence of experimental noise. We discuss different strategies to reconstruct cellular forces as they follow from the foundations of elasticity theory, including two- versus three-dimensional, inverse versus direct and linear versus non-linear approaches. We also discuss how biophysical models can improve force reconstruction and comment on practical issues like substrate preparation, image processing and the availability of software for traction force microscopy.

abstract = {The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the gatekeeper for nuclear transport in eukaryotic cells. A key component of the NPC is the central shaft lined with intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) known as FG-Nups, which control the selective molecular traffic. Here, we present an approach to realize artificial NPC mimics that allows controlling the type and copy number of FG-Nups. We constructed 34 nm-wide 3D DNA origami rings and attached different numbers of NSP1, a model yeast FG-Nup, or NSP1-S, a hydrophilic mutant. Using (cryo) electron microscopy, we find that NSP1 forms denser cohesive networks inside the ring compared to NSP1-S. Consistent with this, the measured ionic conductance is lower for NSP1 than for NSP1-S. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal spatially varying protein densities and conductances in good agreement with the experiments. Our technique provides an experimental platform for deciphering the collective behavior of IDPs with full control of their type and position.},

Mechanical and biochemical factors alter the biomechanical properties of tissues by driving cellular remodeling of the ECM. This review provides an overview of the structural, compositional, and mechanical properties of the ECM that instruct cell behaviors. Case studies are reviewed that highlight mechanotransduction in the context of two distinct tissues: tendons and the heart. Although these two tissues demonstrate differences in relative cell-ECM composition and mechanical environment, they share similar mechanisms underlying ECM dysfunction and cell mechanotransduction. Together, these topics provide a framework for a fundamental understanding of the ECM and how it may vary across normal and diseased tissues in response to mechanical and biochemical cues.

abstract = {The dynamics of formation of macromolecular structures in adherent membranes is a key to a number of cellular processes. However, the interplay between protein reaction kinetics, diffusion and the morphology of the growing domains, governed by membrane mediated interactions, is still poorly understood. Here we show, experimentally and in simulations, that a rich phase diagram emerges from the competition between binding, cooperativity, molecular crowding and membrane spreading. In the cellular context, the spontaneously-occurring organization of adhesion domains in ring-like morphologies is particularly interesting. These are stabilized by the crowding of bulky proteins, and the membrane-transmitted correlations between bonds. Depending on the density of the receptors, this phase may be circumvented, and instead, the adhesions may grow homogeneously in the contact zone between two membranes. If the development of adhesion occurs simultaneously with membrane spreading, much higher accumulation of binders can be achieved depending on the velocity of spreading. The mechanisms identified here, in the context of our mimetic model, may shed light on the structuring of adhesions in the contact zones between two living cells.

@article{Sackmann2015,
abstract = {Cell-tissue-tissue interaction is determined by specific short range forces between cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and ligands of the tissue, long range repulsion forces mediated by cell surface grafted macromolecules and adhesion-induced elastic stresses in the cell envelope. This interplay of forces triggers the rapid random clustering of tightly coupled linkers. By coupling of actin gel patches to the intracellular domains of the CAMs, these clusters can grow in a secondary process resulting in the formation of functional adhesion microdomains (ADs). The ADs can act as biochemical steering centers by recruiting and activating functional proteins, such as GTPases and associated regulating proteins, through electrostatic-hydrophobic forces with cationic lipid domains that act as attractive centers.First, I summarize physical concepts of cell adhesion revealed by studies of biomimetic systems. Then I describe the role of the adhesion domains as biochemical signaling platforms and force transmission centers promoting cellular protrusions, in terms of a shell string model of cells. Protrusion forces are generated by actin gelation triggered by molecular machines (focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src-kinases and associated adaptors) which assemble around newly formed integrin clusters. They recruit and activate the GTPases Rac-1 and actin gelation promoters to charged membrane domains via electrostatic-hydrophobic forces. The cell front is pushed forward in a cyclic and stepwise manner and the step-width is determined by the dynamics antagonistic interplay between Rac-1 and RhoA. The global cell polarization in the direction of motion is mediated by the actin-microtubule (MT) crosstalk at adhesion domains. Supramolecular actin-MT assemblies at the front help to promote actin polymerization. At the rear they regulate the dismantling of the ADs through the Ca++-mediated activation of the protease calpain and trigger their disruption by RhoA mediated contraction via stress fibers.

abstract = {We previously found that a polymer conjugated to the anticancer protein neocarzinostatin, named smancs, accumulated more in tumor tissues than did neocarzinostatin. To determine the general mechanism of this tumoritropic accumulation of smancs and other proteins, we used radioactive (51Cr-labeled) proteins of various molecular sizes (Mr 12,000 to 160,000) and other properties. In addition, we used dye-complexed serum albumin to visualize the accumulation in tumors of tumor-bearing mice. Many proteins progressively accumulated in the tumor tissues of these mice, and a ratio of the protein concentration in the tumor to that in the blood of 5 was obtained within 19 to 72 h. A large protein like immunoglobulin G required a longer time to reach this value of 5. The protein concentration ratio in the tumor to that in the blood of neither 1 nor 5 was achieved with neocarzinostatin, a representative of a small protein (Mr 12,000) in all time. We speculate that the tumoritropic accumulation of these proteins resulted because of the hypervasculature, an enhanced permeability to even macromolecules, and little recovery through either blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. This accumulation of macromolecules in the tumor was also found after i.v. injection of an albumin-dye complex (Mr 69,000), as well as after injection into normal and tumor tissues. The complex was retained only by tumor tissue for prolonged periods. There was little lymphatic recovery of macromolecules from tumor tissue. The present finding is of potential value in macromolecular tumor therapeutics and diagnosis.},

Significant accumulation of Au in kidney (up to 5.5 ± 2.5 ng/g) and testis (up to 0.6 ± 0.1 ng/g) occurred from 1 month post-injection when Au level in urine and feces decreased. Significant increase of Au in blood occurred 2 months after injection, coincident with the delayed accumulation in kidney. Au accumulation in lungs was found at 1 day post-injection but decreased within a week. No accumulation of Au was found in the brain. Microarray results of liver and spleen point to significant effects on genes related to detoxification, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, defense response, and circadian rhythm. These results demonstrate that significant biodistribution of Au occurs in the body over 2 months after a single i.v. injection of AuNPs, accompanied by gene expression changes in target organs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we show that quantum dots functionalized with high-affinity small-molecule ligands that target tumours can also be cleared by the kidneys if their hydrodynamic diameter is less than this value, which sets an upper limit of 5-10 ligands per quantum dot for renal clearance. Animal models of prostate cancer and melanoma show receptor-specific imaging and renal clearance within 4 h post-injection.

The new challenge in bioimaging is to design chemical probes for three-dimensional (3D) tissue imaging. In this work, we discovered that light scattering of metal nanoparticles can provide 3D imaging contrast in intact and transparent tissues. The nanoparticles can act as a template for the chemical growth of a metal layer to further enhance the scattering signal. The use of chemically grown nanoparticles in whole tissues can amplify the scattering to produce a 1.4 million-fold greater photon yield than obtained using common fluorophores. These probes are non-photobleaching and can be used alongside fluorophores without interference. We demonstrated three distinct biomedical applications: (a) molecular imaging of blood vessels, (b) tracking of nanodrug carriers in tumors, and (c) mapping of lesions and immune cells in a multiple sclerosis mouse model. Our strategy establishes a distinct yet complementary set of imaging probes for understanding disease mechanisms in three dimensions.},

abstract = {Gold nanorods have strong absorbance in the near infrared region, which penetrates deeply into tissues, where the absorbed light energy is converted into heat. Therefore, gold nanorods are expected to act as an effective contrast agent for in vivo bioimaging and as a thermal converter for photothermal therapy. We grafted various amounts of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the surface of gold nanorods and investigated the effects of grafting level and injection dose on the biodistribution in the tumor-bearing mice after intravenous injection and enhanced permeability and retention (EPR). Higher PEG grafting levels were advantageous for reticuloendothelial system (RES) avoidance and for suppression of aggregation of the gold nanorods in the circulation. Modification with a PEG:gold molar ratio of 1.5 was sufficient to show both prolonged circulation and the EPR effect. When the injection dose was increased above 19.5 $\mu$g of gold, the RES uptake in the liver was saturated and surplus gold nanorods were distributed to other tissues, especially the spleen and the tumor. The results of this study will provide an important basis for the development of cancer therapies mediated by the photothermal effect of gold nanorods. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We describe evidence for a novel mechanism of monoclonal antibody (MAb)-directed nanoparticle (immunoliposome) targeting to solid tumors in vivo. Long-circulating immunoliposomes targeted to HER2 (ErbB2, Neu) were prepared by the conjugation of anti-HER2 MAb fragments (Fab' or single chain Fv) to liposome-grafted polyethylene glycol chains. MAb fragment conjugation did not affect the biodistribution or long-circulating properties of i.v.-administered liposomes. However, antibody-directed targeting also did not increase the tumor localization of immunoliposomes, as both targeted and nontargeted liposomes achieved similarly high levels (7-8{\%} injected dose/g tumor tissue) of tumor tissue accumulation in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer xenografts (BT-474). Studies using colloidal gold-labeled liposomes showed the accumulation of anti-HER2 immunoliposomes within cancer cells, whereas matched nontargeted liposomes were located predominantly in extracellular stroma or within macrophages. A similar pattern of stromal accumulation without cancer cell internalization was observed for anti-HER2 immunoliposomes in non-HER2-overexpressing breast cancer xenografts (MCF-7). Flow cytometry of disaggregated tumors posttreatment with either liposomes or immunoliposomes showed up to 6-fold greater intracellular uptake in cancer cells due to targeting. Thus, in contrast to nontargeted liposomes, anti-HER2 immunoliposomes achieved intracellular drug delivery via MAb-mediated endocytosis, and this, rather than increased uptake in tumor tissue, was correlated with superior antitumor activity. Immunoliposomes capable of selective internalization in cancer cells in vivo may provide new opportunities for drug delivery.},

In a prospective single center study, CTC were enumerated with the CellSearch system in 30 ml of peripheral blood of 403 stage I-III patients before undergoing surgery for breast cancer (A) and if available 1 week after surgery (B), after adjuvant chemo- and/or radiotherapy or before start of long-term hormonal therapy (C), one (D), two (E) and three (F) years after surgery.

abstract = {Cardiovascular toxicity is a potential short- or long-term complication of anticancer therapy. Exposure to chemotherapy medications, primarily the anthracycline class, can lead to potentially irreversible clinically significant cardiac dysfunction. The advent of novel biologic agents, including monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has revolutionized the treatment of several types of malignancies. Although targeted therapies are considered less toxic and better tolerated by patients compared with classic chemotherapy agents, rare serious complications have been observed; and longer-term follow-up is needed to determine the exact profile of related cardiac adverse effects. Cardiac toxicity associated with cancer therapies can range from asymptomatic subclinical abnormalities, including electrocardiographic changes and temporary left ventricular ejection fraction decline, to life-threatening events such as congestive heart failure or acute coronary syndromes. Assessment of the prevalence, type, and severity of cardiac toxicity caused by various cancer treatments is a critical topic for patient management and specifically for new drug development. Guidelines for monitoring cardiac adverse effects have been formulated; however, appropriate supportive evidence remains limited. Given the rate of new drug development designed to fulfill unmet oncologic needs, efforts are needed to promote strategies for cardiac risk detection and management and to avoid unintended consequences potentially impeding development of, regulatory approval for, and patient access to novel therapies. These advances require ongoing research to assess and manage the cardiovascular safety of patients treated with anticancer agents, as well as a well-organized collaboration between oncologists and cardiologists. The aim of this review is to summarize potential cardiovascular toxicities for a range of cancer chemotherapeutics and to review general mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity for each agent. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Considerable differences in the protein adsorption with regard to preferential adsorbed proteins were detectable for the different functional groups. Possible correlations between the surface characteristics and the protein adsorption are shown and discussed.

Methodologies to determine the corona and to understand its dependence on nanomaterial properties are likely to become important in bionanoscience. Here, we study the long-lived ("hard") protein corona formed from human plasma for a range of nanoparticles that differ in surface properties and size. Six different polystyrene nanoparticles were studied: three different surface chemistries (plain PS, carboxyl-modified, and amine-modified) and two sizes of each (50 and 100 nm), enabling us to perform systematic studies of the effect of surface properties and size on the detailed protein coronas. Proteins in the corona that are conserved and unique across the nanoparticle types were identified and classified according to the protein functional properties. Remarkably, both size and surface properties were found to play a very significant role in determining the nanoparticle coronas on the different particles of identical materials. We comment on the future need for scientific understanding, characterization, and possibly some additional emphasis on standards for the surfaces of nanoparticles.},

Parameters such as nanoparticle binding, internalization rate constants, and accessible volume fraction were determined experimentally. Unknown parameters of nanoparticle binding sites per cell in the spheroid and pore shape factor were determined by fitting to experimental data. The model was correlated with experimental studies of the penetration of 40 nm nanoparticles in SiHa multicellular spheroids with and without collagenase treatment and was able to accurately predict concentration profiles of nanoparticles within spheroids. The model was also used to investigate the effects of nanoparticle size. This model contributes toward the understanding of the role of tumor architecture on nanoparticle delivery efficiency.},

As a result, the visualizations are subject to the fundamental limitations of metric spaces. These limitations prevent multidimensional scaling from faithfully representing non-metric similarity data such as word associations or event co-occurrences. In particular, multidimensional scaling cannot faithfully represent intransitive pairwise similarities in a visualization, and it cannot faithfully visualize “central” objects. In this paper, we present an extension of a recently proposed multidimensional scaling technique called t-SNE. The extension aims to address the problems of traditional multidimensional scaling techniques when these techniques are used to visualize non-metric similarities. The new technique, called multiple maps t-SNE, alleviates these problems by constructing a collection of maps that reveal complementary structure in the similarity data. We apply multiple maps t-SNE to a large data set of word association data and to a data set of NIPS co-authorships, demonstrating its ability to successfully visualize non-metric similarities.},

For successful delivery and targeting, it is therefore important to assess on a quantitative basis how and to what extent the presence of the corona perturbs the specific interaction of a designed NP with its cellular target. We present a theoretical systems-level analysis, in which peptides have been covalently coupled to the surface of nanoparticles, describing the delivery success rate in varying conditions, with regard to protein composition of the surrounding fluid.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tools are lacking to assess the individual risk of severe toxicity from chemotherapy. Such tools would be especially useful for older patients, who vary considerably in terms of health status and functional reserve. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective, multicentric study of patients aged {\textgreater}/=70 years who were starting chemotherapy. Grade 4 hematologic (H) or grade 3/4 nonhematologic (NH) toxicity according to version 3.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events was defined as severe. Twenty-four parameters were assessed. Toxicity of the regimen (Chemotox) was adjusted using an index to estimate the average per-patient risk of chemotherapy toxicity (the MAX2 index). In total, 562 patients were accrued, and 518 patients were evaluable and were split randomly (2:1 ratio) into a derivation cohort and a validation cohort. RESULTS: Severe toxicity was observed in 64{\%} of patients. The Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients (CRASH) score was constructed along 2 subscores: H toxicity and NH toxicity. Predictors of H toxicity were lymphocytes, aspartate aminotransferase level, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score, lactate dehydrogenase level, diastolic blood pressure, and Chemotox. The best model included the 4 latter predictors (risk categories: low, 7{\%}; medium-low, 23{\%}; medium-high, 54{\%}; and high, 100{\%}, respectively; P(trend) {\textless} .001). Predictors of NH toxicity were hemoglobin, creatinine clearance, albumin, self-rated health, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance, Mini-Mental Status score, Mini-Nutritional Assessment score, and Chemotox. The 4 latter predictors provided the best model (risk categories: 33{\%}, 46{\%}, 67{\%}, and 93{\%}, respectively; P(trend) {\textless} .001). The combined risk categories were 50{\%}, 58{\%}, 77{\%}, and 79{\%}, respectively; P(trend) {\textless} .001). Bootstrap internal validation and independent sample validation demonstrated stable risk categorization and P(trend) {\textless} .001. CONCLUSIONS: The CRASH score distinguished several risk levels of severe toxicity. The split score discriminated better than the combined score. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first score systematically integrating both chemotherapy and patient risk for older patients and has a potential for future clinical application.},

abstract = {Enhanced permeability in tumours is thought to result from malformed vascular walls with leaky cell-to-cell junctions. This assertion is backed by studies using electron microscopy and polymer casts that show incomplete pericyte coverage of tumour vessels and the presence of intercellular gaps. However, this gives the impression that tumour permeability is static amid a chaotic tumour environment. Using intravital confocal laser scanning microscopy we show that the permeability of tumour blood vessels includes a dynamic phenomenon characterized by vascular bursts followed by brief vigorous outward flow of fluid (named 'eruptions') into the tumour interstitial space. We propose that 'dynamic vents' form transient openings and closings at these leaky blood vessels. These stochastic eruptions may explain the enhanced extravasation of nanoparticles from the tumour blood vessels, and offer insights into the underlying distribution patterns of an administered drug.},

With hundreds of nucleotides, each presumably cap- T has sometimes been suggested that the wild-type allele is not a single entity, able of base substitutions and with additional permutations possible through se- quence rearrangements, gains, and losses, the number of possible gene states becomes astronomical. It is known that a single nucleotide substitution can have the most drastic consequences, but there are also mutations with very minute effects and there is the possibility that many are so small as to be undetectable. It is not the purpose of this article to discuss the plausibility of such a system of isoalleles, or the evidence for and against. Instead, we propose to examine some of the population consequences of such a system if it does exist. The probability seems great enough to warrant such an inquiry. If a large number of different states can arise by mutation, this doesn't neces- sarily mean that a large fraction of these would coexist in a single population. Some will be lost by random drift and others may be selectively disadvantageous. On the other hand, some may persist by being beneficial in heterozygous combinations. We shall consider three possibilities: (1) A system of selectively neutral isoalleles whose frequency in the population is determined by the mutation rate and by random drift. (2) A system of mutually heterotic alleles. (3) A mixture of heterotic and harmful mutants.},

abstract = {Recent studies have firmly established that cellular uptake of nanoparticles is strongly affected by the presence and the physicochem. properties of a protein adsorption layer around these nanoparticles. Here, the authors have modified human serum albumin (HSA), a serum protein often used in model studies of protein adsorption onto nanoparticles, to alter its surface charge distribution and studied the consequences for protein corona formation around small (radius ∼5 nm), dihydrolipoic acid-coated quantum dots (DHLA-QDs) by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. HSA modified by succinic anhydride (HSAsuc) to generate addnl. carboxyl groups on the protein surface showed a 3-fold decreased binding affinity toward the nanoparticles. A 1000-fold enhanced affinity was obsd. for HSA modified by ethylenediamine (HSAam) to increase the no. of amino functions on the protein surface. Remarkably, HSAsuc formed a much thicker protein adsorption layer (8.1 nm) than native HSA (3.3 nm), indicating that it binds in a distinctly different orientation on the nanoparticle, whereas the HSAam corona (4.6 nm) is only slightly thicker. Notably, protein binding to DHLA-QDs is entirely reversible, independent of the modification. The authors have also measured the extent and kinetics of internalization of these nanoparticles without and with adsorbed native and modified HSA by HeLa cells. Pronounced variations were obsd., indicating that even small physicochem. changes of the protein corona may affect biol. responses. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {The relationship between the two estimates of genetic variation at the DNA level, namely the number of segregating sites and the average number of nucleotide differences estimated from pairwise comparison, is investigated. It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

This review provides an update of tumor targeting with conventional or long-circulating nanoparticles. The in vivo fate of these systems, after intravascular or tumoral administration, is discussed, as well as the mechanism involved in tumor regression. Nanoparticles are also of benefit for the selective delivery of oligonucleotides to tumor cells. Moreover, certain types of nanoparticles showed some interesting capacity to reverse MDR resistance, which is a major problem in chemotherapy. The first experiments, aiming to decorate nanoparticles with molecular ligand for 'active' targeting of cancerous cells, are also discussed here.

abstract = {The importance of the protein corona formed around nanoparticles upon entering a biological fluid has recently been highlighted. This corona is, when sufficiently long-lived, thought to govern the particles' biological fate. However, even this long-lived "hard" corona evolves and re-equilibrates as particles pass from one biological fluid to another, and may be an important feature for long-term fate. Here we show the evolution of the protein corona as a result of transfer of nanoparticles from one biological fluid (plasma) into another (cytosolic fluid), a simple illustrative model for the uptake of nanoparticles into cells. While no direct comparison can be made to what would happen in, for example, the uptake pathway, the results confirm that significant evolution of the corona occurs in the second biological solution, but that the final corona contains a "fingerprint" of its history. This could be evolved to map the transport pathways utilized by nanoparticles, and eventually to predict nanoparticle fate and behavior.},

abstract = {We propose a statistical dynamical theory for the violation of the hydrodynamic Stokes-Einstein (SE) diffusion law for a spherical nanoparticle in entangled and unentangled polymer melts based on a combination of mode coupling, Brownian motion, and polymer physics ideas. The non-hydrodynamic friction coefficient is related to microscopic equilibrium structure and the length-scale-dependent polymer melt collective density fluctuation relaxation time. When local packing correlations are neglected, analytic scaling laws (with numerical prefactors) in various regimes are derived for the non-hydrodynamic diffusivity as a function of particle size, polymer radius-of-gyration, tube diameter, degree of entanglement, melt density, and temperature. Entanglement effects are the origin of large SE violations (orders of magnitude mobility enhancement) which smoothly increase as the ratio of particle radius to tube diameter decreases. Various crossover conditions for the recovery of the SE law are derived, which are qualitatively distinct for unentangled and entangled melts. The dynamical influence of packing correlations due to both repulsive and interfacial attractive forces is investigated. A central finding is that melt packing fraction, temperature, and interfacial attraction strength all influence the SE violation in qualitatively different directions depending on whether the polymers are entangled or not. Entangled systems exhibit seemingly anomalous trends as a function of these variables as a consequence of the non-diffusive nature of collective density fluctuation relaxation and the different response of polymer-particle structural correlations to adsorption on the mesoscopic entanglement length scale. The theory is in surprisingly good agreement with recent melt experiments, and new parametric studies are suggested.},

abstract = {Protein adsorption to nanoparticles (NPs) is a key prerequisite to understand NP-cell interactions. While the layer thickness of the protein corona has been well characterized in many cases, the absolute number of bound proteins and their exchange dynamics in body fluids is difficult to assess. Here we measure the number of molecules adsorbed to sulfonate (PSOSO(3)H) and carboxyl-(PSCOOH) polystyrene NPs using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We find that the fraction of molecules bound to NPs falls onto a single, universal adsorption curve, if plotted as a function of molar protein-to-NP ratio. The adsorption curve shows the build-up of a strongly bound monolayer up to the point of monolayer saturation (at a geometrically defined protein-to-NP ratio), beyond which a secondary, weakly bound layer is formed. While the first layer is irreversibly bound (hard corona), the secondary layer (soft corona) exhibits dynamic exchange, if competing unlabeled is added. In the presence of plasma proteins, the hard corona is stable, while the soft corona is almost completely removed. The existence of two distinct time scales in the protein off-kinetics, for both NP types studied here, indicates the possibility of an exposure memory effect in the NP corona.},

These proteins rapidly adsorb onto the nanoparticle surface, creating a protein corona. Poly(ethylene glycol) can reduce, but not eliminate, the nonspecific adsorption of proteins. As a result, the adsorbed proteins, rather than the nanoparticle itself, determine the cellular receptors used for binding, the internalization mechanism, the intracellular transport pathway, and the subsequent immune response. Using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, we first characterize a set of polystyrene nanoparticles in which the same adsorbed protein, bovine serum albumin, leads to binding to two different cell surface receptors: native albumin receptors and scavenger receptors. Using a combination of circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and fluorescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the secondary structure of the adsorbed bovine serum albumin protein controls the cellular receptors used by the protein-nanoparticle complexes. These results show that protein secondary structure is a key parameter in determining the cell surface receptor used by a protein-nanoparticle complex. We expect this link between protein structure and cellular outcomes will provide a molecular basis for the design of nanoparticles for use in biological and biomedical applications.},

Since the targets of many therapeutic agents are localized in subcellular compartments, modulation of nanoparticle-cell interactions for efficient cellular uptake through the plasma membrane and the development of nanomedicines for precise delivery to subcellular compartments remain formidable challenges. Cellular internalization routes determine the post-internalization fate and intracellular localization of nanoparticles. This review highlights the cellular uptake routes most relevant to the field of non-targeted nanomedicine and presents an account of ligand-targeted nanoparticles for receptor-mediated cellular internalization as a strategy for modulating the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. Ligand-targeted nanoparticles have been the main impetus behind the progress of nanomedicines towards the clinic. This strategy has already resulted in remarkable progress towards effective oral delivery of nanomedicines that can overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier. A detailed overview of the recent developments in subcellular targeting as a novel platform for next-generation organelle-specific nanomedicines is also provided.

abstract = {It is well recognized that the primary interaction of most biological environments with nanoparticles (NPs) is strongly influenced by a long-lived ("hard") protein corona that surrounds the NP and remains strongly adsorbed to its surface. The amount and composition of associated proteins in the corona adsorbed onto the NPs is related to several important factors, including the physicochemical properties of the NPs and the composition of the protein solution. Here, for the first time, it is shown that plasmonic heat induction (by laser activation) leads to significant changes in the composition of the hard protein corona adsorbed on low aspect ratio gold nanorods. Using mass spectrometry, several proteins in the corona were identified whose concentrations change most substantially as a result of photoinduced (plasmonic) heating versus simple thermal heating. Molecular modeling suggests that the origin of these changes in protein adsorption may be the result of protein conformational changes in response to much higher local temperatures that occur near the gold nanorods during photoinduced, plasmonic heating. These results may define new applications in vivo for NPs with hyperthermia capability and better define the likely interactions of cells with NPs after plasmonic heating. Potential changes in the protein corona following hyperthermia treatment may influence the final biological fate of plasmonic NPs in clinical applications and help elucidate safety considerations for hyperthermia applications.},

Understanding the corona formation process is crucial in predicting nanoparticle behavior in biological systems, including applications of nanotoxicology and development of nano drug delivery platforms. METHOD This paper extends the modeling work in to derive a mathematical model describing the dynamics of nanoparticle corona complex formation from population balance equations. We apply nonlinear dynamics techniques to derive analytical results for the composition of nanoparticle-protein corona complex, and validate our results through numerical simulations. RESULTS The model presented in this paper exhibits two phases of corona complex dynamics. In the first phase, proteins rapidly bind to the free surface of nanoparticles, leading to a metastable composition. During the second phase, continuous association and dissociation of protein molecules with nanoparticles slowly changes the composition of the corona complex. Given sufficient time, composition of the corona complex reaches an equilibrium state of stable composition. We find analytical approximate formulae for metastable and stable compositions of corona complex. Our formulae are very well-structured to clearly identify important parameters determining corona composition. CONCLUSION The dynamics of biocorona formation constitute vital aspect of interactions between nanoparticles and living organisms. Our results further understanding of these dynamics through quantitation of experimental conditions, modeling results for in vitro systems to better predict behavior for in vivo systems. One potential application would involve a single cell culture medium related to a complex protein medium, such as blood or tissue fluid.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nanoparticles in contact with biological fluids interact with proteins and other biomolecules, thus forming a dynamic corona whose composition varies over time due to continuous protein association and dissociation events. Eventually equilibrium is reached, at which point the continued exchange will not affect the composition of the corona. RESULTS: We developed a simple and effective dynamic model of the nanoparticle protein corona in a body fluid, namely human plasma. The model predicts the time evolution and equilibrium composition of the corona based on affinities, stoichiometries and rate constants. An application to the interaction of human serum albumin, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and fibrinogen with 70 nm N-iso-propylacrylamide/N-tert-butylacrylamide copolymer nanoparticles is presented, including novel experimental data for HDL. CONCLUSIONS: The simple model presented here can easily be modified to mimic the interaction of the nanoparticle protein corona with a novel biological fluid or compartment once new data will be available, thus opening novel applications in nanotoxicity and nanomedicine.},

We used replicate laboratory populations of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for direct observation of critical slowing down before population collapse. We mapped the bifurcation diagram experimentally and found that the populations became more vulnerable to disturbance closer to the tipping point. Fluctuations of population density increased in size and duration near the tipping point, in agreement with the theory. Our results suggest that indicators of critical slowing down can provide advance warning of catastrophic thresholds and loss of resilience in a variety of dynamical systems.},

abstract = {Recently, a new group of multicellular microorganisms was discovered, called ‘cable bacteria' which are capable of generating and mediating electrical currents across centimetre-scale distances. By transporting electrons from cell to cell, cable bacteria can harvest electron donors and electron acceptors that are widely separated in space, thus providing them with a competitive advantage for survival in aquatic sediments. The underlying process of long-distance electron transport challenges some long-held ideas about the energy metabolism of multicellular organisms and entails a whole new type of electrical cooperation between cells. This review summarizes the current knowledge about these intriguing multicellular bacteria. Cable bacteria are a newly discovered group of multicellular bacteria that generate and mediate electrical currents along their long filamentous body. Long-distance electron transport by cable bacteria bridges centimeter distances and extends the known length scale of biological electron transport by orders of magnitude. Long-distance electron transport allows cable bacteria to harvest electron donors and electron acceptors in widely separated locations, thus challenging long-held ideas on redox zonation in subsurface environments. By generating electrical currents, cable bacteria induce measurable electrical fields and potentials within their environment, and turn aquatic sediments into a living battery. Their widespread occurrence and strong imprint on local biogeochemistry suggests that cable bacteria are important in the cycling of carbon, sulfur, and other elements.},

abstract = {Biofilms are found within the lungs of patients with chronic pulmonary infections, in particular patients with cystic fibrosis, and are the major cause of morbidity and mortality for these patients. The work presented here is part of a large interdisciplinary effort to develop an effective drug delivery system and treatment strategy to kill biofilms growing in the lung. The treatment strategy exploits silver-based antimicrobials, in particular, silver carbene complexes (SCC). This manuscript presents a mathematical model describing the growth of a biofilm and predicts the response of a biofilm to several basic treatment strategies. The continuum model is composed of a set of reaction-diffusion equations for the transport of soluble components (nutrient and antimicrobial), coupled to a set of reaction-advection equations for the particulate components (living, inert, and persister bacteria, extracellular polymeric substance, and void). We explore the efficacy of delivering SCC both in an aqueous solution and in biodegradable polymer nanoparticles. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) levels of antimicrobial in both free and nanoparticle-encapsulated forms are estimated. Antimicrobial treatment demonstrates a biphasic killing phenomenon, where the active bacterial population is killed quickly followed by a slower killing rate, which indicates the presence of a persister population. Finally, our results suggest that a biofilm with a ready supply of nutrient throughout its depth has fewer persister bacteria and hence may be easier to treat than one with less nutrient. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), linked with CRISPR associated (Cas) genes, can confer adaptive immunity to bacteria, against bacteriophage infections. Thus from a therapeutic standpoint, CRISPR immunity increases biofilm resistance to phage therapy. Recently, however, CRISPR-Cas genes have been implicated in reducing biofilm formation in lysogenized cells. Thus CRISPR immunity can have complex effects on phage–host–lysogen interactions, particularly in a biofilm. In this contribution, we develop and analyse a series of dynamical systems to elucidate and disentangle these interactions. Two competition models are used to study the effects of lysogens (first model) and CRISPR-immune bacteria (second model) in the biofilm. In the third model, the effect of delivering lysogens to a CRISPR-immune biofilm is investigated. Using standard analyses of equilibria, stability and bifurcations, our models predict that lysogens may be able to displace CRISPR-immune bacteria in a biofilm, and thus suggest strategies to eliminate phage-resistant biofilms.},

To better understand the relationship between the lung microbiome and early respiratory disease, we characterized the lower airways microbiome using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from clinically stable CF infants and preschoolers who underwent bronchoscopy and chest computed tomography (CT). Cross-sectional samples suggested a progression of the lower airways microbiome with age, beginning with relatively sterile airways in infancy. By age two, bacterial sequences typically associated with the oral cavity dominated lower airways samples in many CF subjects. The presence of an oral-like lower airways microbiome correlated with a significant increase in bacterial density and inflammation. These early changes occurred in many patients, despite the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in our cohort during the first two years of life. The majority of CF subjects older than four harbored a pathogen dominated airway microbiome, which was associated with a further increase in inflammation and the onset of structural lung disease, despite a negligible increase in bacterial density compared to younger patients with an oral-like airway microbiome. Our findings suggest that changes within the CF lower airways microbiome occur during the first years of life and that distinct microbial signatures are associated with the progression of early CF lung disease.},

These two systems involve gels, which are mixtures composed of a polymer network permeated by water. The fluid mechanics of these systems is essential to their biological function and structure. Their mathematical descriptions must account for the mechanics of the polymer, the water, and the interaction between these two phases. This review focuses on multiphase flow models because this framework is natural for including the relative motion between the phases, the exchange of material between phases, and the additional stresses within the network that arise from nonspecific chemical interactions and the action of molecular motors. These models have been successful in accounting for how different forces are generated and transmitted to achieve cell motion and biofilm growth and they have demonstrated how emergent structures develop though the interactions of the two phases.

abstract = {Oral biofilms, unlike those formed at most other sites in the human body, are unique because surgical intervention is usually unnecessary for their removal. The control of oral biofilms relies mainly on mechanical elimination. Chemical controls are used as alternative or adjunctive methods when elimination using dental instruments proves difficult. For many years, researches have focused on how microorganisms could be rapidly killed using high concentrations of antimicrobials or new antibacterial agents. New strategies that target the matrices of mature biofilms are needed because biofilm matrices inhibit the effect of antimicrobial agents through absorption and degradation. These strategies include the following possibilities: (1) use of antimicrobial agents with superior penetration properties and (2) degradation or detachment of matrix polymers. In order to investigate the penetration properties of antimicrobial agents, time-lapse microscopy can be used for noninvasive visualization of antimicrobial action inside models of oral biofilms. Factors that affect drug penetration properties include molecular weight, charge, hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance, and malabsorption/modification by the biofilm matrix. However, strategies that rely on antimicrobial agents have an important limitation. Even if the microorganisms are eradicated, their biofilm structure remains intact and may promote secondary biofilm and tartar formation. Therefore, future strategies should shift their focus to degradation and/or removal of matrix polymers. Some detachment-promoting agents have been reported. These agents have the potential to control biofilm accumulation effectively. Since the clinical efficacy remains unclear, and in addition to limitations of targeting a specific polysaccharide component and retention properties, further investigations are warranted. {\textcopyright} 2012 Japanese Association for Oral Biology.},

This suggests that P. aeruginosa might exist as biofilms--structured communities of bacteria encased in a self-produced polymeric matrix--in the cystic fibrosis lung. Consistent with this hypothesis, microscopy of cystic fibrosis sputum shows that P. aeruginosa are in biofilm-like structures. P. aeruginosa uses extracellular quorum-sensing signals (extracellular chemical signals that cue cell-density-dependent gene expression) to coordinate biofilm formation. Here we found that cystic fibrosis sputum produces the two principal P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing signals; however, the relative abundance of these signals was opposite to that of the standard P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 in laboratory broth culture. When P. aeruginosa sputum isolates were grown in broth, some showed quorum-sensing signal ratios like those of the laboratory strain. When we grew these isolates and PAO1 in a laboratory biofilm model, the signal ratios were like those in cystic fibrosis sputum. Our data support the hypothesis that P. aeruginosa are in a biofilm in cystic fibrosis sputum. Moreover, quorum-sensing signal profiling of specific P. aeruginosa strains may serve as a biomarker in screens to identify agents that interfere with biofilm development.},

Second, CsgA fibres protect cells individually by coating their surface and binding phage particles, thereby preventing their attachment to the cell exterior.

Reaction-diffusion theory was adapted to investigate the potential for transport limitation of the overall rate of biofilm disinfection and the rate of antimicrobial penetration into the biofilm. Disinfection efficacy was investigated with simulations that assumed catalytic reaction of the antimicrobial agent with live and dead cells in a uniformly thick slab with simultaneous transformation of live to dead cells by an independent rate process (disinfection). The intrinsic rate of disinfection was assumed to follow first-order dependence on antimicrobial concentration. Zero- and first-order reaction kinetics of antimicrobial agent with biomass were analyzed. Microbial growth and external mass transfer resistance were neglected. Results show that antimicrobial efficacy, defined as the ratio of the observed rate of biofilm disinfection to the rate that would prevail in the absence of mass transport limitation, decreases sharply as the Thiele modulus exceeds one. The reduction in efficacy worsens when the antimicrobial dose is more concentrated or longer. A second case examined the penetration of an antimicrobial agent into a biofilm with which it reacts stoichiometrically, as would be expected with an oxidizing biocide such as chlorine or ozone. The antimicrobial agent eventually penetrates the biofilm by depleting the reactive biomass constituent, but the time scale for penetration can exceed the time scale for transient diffusion in the absence of reaction by orders of magnitute. These results provide a theoretical basis for explaining experimentally observed resistance of biofilms to chemical disinfectants. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

In this model we consider photosynthesis, extracellular matrix excretion, and mortality. These mechanisms are described precisely using kinetic laws that take into account some saturation effects which limit the reaction rates and involve different components that we treat individually. In particular, to obtain a more detailed description of the microalgae growth, we consider separately the lipids they contain and the functional part of microalgae (proteins, RNA, etc {\ldots}), the latter playing a leading role in photosynthesis. We also consider the components dissolved in liquid phase as CO2. The model is based on mixture theory and the behaviour of each component is described on the one hand by mass conservation, which takes into account biological features of the system, and on the other hand by conservation of momentum, which describes the physical properties of the components. Some numerical simulations are displayed in the one-dimensional case and show that the model is able to estimate accurately the biofilm productivity.},

abstract = {Fluid-structure interactions strongly affect, in multiple ways, the structure and function of cellular biological media, such as tissues, biofilms, and cell-entrapping gels. Mathematical models and computer simulation are important tools in advancing our understanding of these interactions, interpreting experimental observations, and designing novel processes and biomaterials. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and highlight promising directions of future research on theoretical modeling of momentum transport in cellular biological media with focus on the formulation of governing equations and the calculation of material properties both theoretically and experimentally. With regard to the governing equations, significant work has been done with single-scale approaches (e.g. mixture theory), whereas traditional upscaling methods (e.g. homogenization, volume averaging) or multiscale equation-free approaches have received limited attention. The underlying concepts, strengths, and limitations of each approach, as well as examples of use in the field of biomaterials are presented. The current status of knowledge regarding the dependence of macroscopic material properties on the volume fractions, geometry, and intrinsic material properties of the constituent phases (cells, extracellular matrix and fluid) is also presented. The observation of conformational changes that occur at finer levels of the structural hierarchy during momentum transport, the correlation of macro-properties with geometrical and topological features of materials with heterogeneous and anisotropic microstructure, as well as the determination of dynamic material properties are among important challenges for future research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Nanomaterials hold promise as multifunctional diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references).},

abstract = {Nanoparticles (NPs) represent one of the most promising tools for drug-targeting and drug-delivery. However, a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics that happen after their in vivo administration is required. Particularly, plasma proteins tend to associate to NPs, forming a new surface named the 'protein corona' (PC). This surface is the most exposed as the 'visible side' of NPs and therefore, can have a strong impact on NP biodistribution, targeting efficacy and also toxicity. The PC consists of two poorly delimited layers, known as 'hard corona' (HC) and 'soft corona' (SC), that are affected by the complexity of the environment and the formed protein-surface equilibrium during in vivo blood circulation. The HC corona is formed by proteins strongly associated to the NPs, while the SC is an outer layer consisting of loosely bound proteins. Several studies attempted to investigate the HC, which is easier to be isolated, but yielded poor reproducibility, due to varying experimental conditions. As a consequence, full mapping of the HC for different NPs is still lacking. Moreover, the current knowledge on the SC, which may play a major role in the 'first' interaction of NPs once in vivo, is very limited, mainly due to the difficulties in preserving it after purification. Therefore, multi-disciplinary approaches leading to the obtainment of a major number of information about the PC and its properties is strongly needed to fully understand its impact and to better support a more safety and conscious application of nanotechnology in medicine.},

Through the application of a variety of single molecule and single particle spectroscopic techniques in combination with ensemble level characterization tools, we identified different interaction pathways between gold nanorods and bovine serum albumin depending on the protein concentration. Overall, we found that local changes in protein concentration influence everything from cancer cell uptake to nanoparticle stability and even protein secondary structure.

Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona.

These properties are rapidly revolutionizing many areas of medicine and technology. Despite the remarkable speed of development of nanoscience, relatively little is known about the interaction of nanoscale objects with living systems. In a biological fluid, proteins associate with nanoparticles, and the amount and presentation of the proteins on the surface of the particles leads to an in vivo response. Proteins compete for the nanoparticle "surface," leading to a protein "corona" that largely defines the biological identity of the particle. Thus, knowledge of rates, affinities, and stoichiometries of protein association with, and dissociation from, nanoparticles is important for understanding the nature of the particle surface seen by the functional machinery of cells. Here we develop approaches to study these parameters and apply them to plasma and simple model systems, albumin and fibrinogen. A series of copolymer nanoparticles are used with variation of size and composition (hydrophobicity). We show that isothermal titration calorimetry is suitable for studying the affinity and stoichiometry of protein binding to nanoparticles. We determine the rates of protein association and dissociation using surface plasmon resonance technology with nanoparticles that are thiol-linked to gold, and through size exclusion chromatography of protein-nanoparticle mixtures. This method is less perturbing than centrifugation, and is developed into a systematic methodology to isolate nanoparticle-associated proteins. The kinetic and equilibrium binding properties depend on protein identity as well as particle surface characteristics and size.},

We then explore the diffusion-osmotic flow of a solute-solvent fluid adjacent to a solid surface, driven by a chemical potential gradient parallel to the surface. We propose a novel non-equilibrium MD (NEMD) methodology to simulate diffusion-osmosis, by imposing an external force on every particle, which properly mimics the chemical potential gradient on the solute in spite of the periodic boundary conditions. This NEMD method is validated theoretically on the basis of linear-response theory by matching the mobility with their Green-Kubo expressions. Finally, we apply the framework to more realistic systems, namely a water-ethanol mixture in contact with a silica or a graphene surface.},

We follow a mechanical point of view of osmotic transport, which allows us to gain much insight into the local mechanical balance underlying osmosis. We demonstrate in particular how the general expression of the osmotic pressure for mixtures, as obtained classically from the thermodynamic framework, emerges from the mechanical balance controlling non-equilibrium transport under solute gradients. Expressions for the rejection coefficient of osmosis and the diffusio-osmotic mobilities are accordingly obtained.

abstract = {Osmosis is a physical phenomenon that has been extensively studied by scientists in various disciplines of science and engineering. Early researchers studied the mechanism of osmosis through natural materials, and from the 1960s, special attention has been given to osmosis through synthetic materials. Following the progress in membrane science in the last few decades, especially for reverse osmosis applications, the interests in engineered applications of osmosis has been spurred. Osmosis, or as it is currently referred to as forward osmosis, has new applications in separation processes for wastewater treatment, food processing, and seawater/brackish water desalination. Other unique areas of forward osmosis research include pressure-retarded osmosis for generation of electricity from saline and fresh water and implantable osmotic pumps for controlled drug release. This paper provides the state-of-the-art of the physical principles and applications of forward osmosis as well as their strengths and limitations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Bacchin2017,
abstract = {The paper presents a theoretical model that allows the dynamic description of osmotic flows through a semi-permeable interface. To depict the out-of-equilibrium transfer, the interface is represented by an energy barrier that colloids have to overcome to be transmitted to the other side of the membrane. This energy barrier thus represents the selectivity of the membrane. Furthermore, this energy barrier induces additional force terms in the momentum and the mass balances on the fluid and the colloids phases. Based on a two- fluid model, these forces can reproduce the physics of the osmotic flow without the use of the semi-empirical laws of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It is shown that a decrease in local pressure near the interface initiates osmosis. When these balance equations are solved in a transient mode, the dynamic of the osmotic flow can be described. The paper illustrates these potentialities by showing the dynamic of an osmosis process occurring in the absence of transmembrane pressure and both the dynamic of the reverse osmosis with a constant flow through the membrane. A simulation reproducing the dynamic of the Abb$\backslash$'e Nollet experiment is presented. The role played by the colloid-membrane interactions on the osmotic flow mechanism and on the counter osmotic pressure is analyzed and discussed in great details.},

abstract = {Systems with interfaces are abundant in both technological applications and biology. While a fluid interface separates two fluids, membranes separate the inside of vesicles from the outside, the interior of biological cells from the environment, and compartmentalize cells into organelles. The physical properties of interfaces are characterized by interface tension, those of membranes are characterized by bending and stretching elasticity. Amphiphilic molecules like surfactants that are added to a system with two immiscible fluids decrease the interface tension and induce a bending rigidity. Lipid bilayer membranes of vesicles can be stretched or compressed by osmotic pressure; in biological cells, also the presence of a cytoskeleton can induce membrane tension. If the thickness of the interface or the membrane is small compared with its lateral extension, both can be described using two-dimensional mathematical surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space. We review recent work on the interaction of particles with interfaces and membranes. This can be micrometer-sized particles at interfaces that stabilise emulsions or form colloidosomes, as well as typically nanometer-sized particles at membranes, such as viruses, parasites, and engineered drug delivery systems. In both cases, we first discuss the interaction of single particles with interfaces and membranes, e.{\~{}}g.$\backslash$ particles in external fields, followed by interface-mediated interaction between two particles, many-particle interactions, interface and membrane curvature-induced phenomena, and applications.},

abstract = {The most consistent result in more than two decades of experimental evolution is that the fitness of populations adapting to a constant environment does not increase indefinitely, but reaches a plateau. Using experimental evolution with bacteriophage, we show here that the converse is also true. In populations small enough such that drift overwhelms selection and causes fitness to decrease, fitness declines down to a plateau. We demonstrate theoretically that both of these phenomena must be due either to changes in the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations, the size of mutational effects, or both. We use mutation accumulation experiments and molecular data from experimental evolution to show that the most significant change in mutational effects is a drastic increase in the rate of beneficial mutation as fitness decreases. In contrast, the size of mutational effects changes little even as organismal fitness changes over several orders of magnitude. These findings have significant implications for the dynamics of adaptation.},

Most of the conventional chemotherapeutic agents have poor pharmacokinetics profiles and are distributed non-specifically in the body leading to systemic toxicity associated with serious side effects. Therefore, the development of drug delivery systems able to target the tumor site is becoming a real challenge that is currently addressed. Nanomedicine can reach tumor passively through the leaky vasculature surrounding the tumors by the Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect whereas ligands grafted at the surface of nanocarriers allow active targeting by binding to the receptors overexpressed by cancer cells or angiogenic endothelial cells. This review is divided into two parts: the first one describes the tumor microenvironment and the second one focuses on the exploitation and the understanding of these characteristics to design new drug delivery systems targeting the tumor.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure PD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general PD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding PD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Inside a GC, B cells compete for antigen and T cell help, and the successful ones continue to evolve. New experimental results suggest that, under identical conditions, a wide spectrum of clonal diversity is observed in different GCs, and high affinity B cells are not always the ones selected. We use a birth, death and mutation model to study clonal competition in a GC over time. We find that, like all evolutionary processes, diversity loss is inherently stochastic. We study two selection mechanisms, birth-limited and death limited selection. While death limited selection maintains diversity and allows for slow clonal homogenization as affinity increases, birth limited selection results in more rapid takeover of successful clones. Finally, we qualitatively compare our model to experimental observations of clonal selection in mice.},

abstract = {This review provides a pedagogic and self-contained introduction to master equations and to their representation by path integrals. We discuss analytical and numerical methods for the solution of master equations, keeping our focus on methods that are applicable even when stochastic fluctuations are strong. The reviewed methods include the generating function technique and the Poisson representation, as well as novel ways of mapping the forward and backward master equations onto linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Spectral methods, WKB approximations, and a variational approach have been proposed for the analysis of the PDE obeyed by the generating function. After outlining these methods, we solve the derived PDEs in terms of two path integrals. The path integrals provide distinct exact representations of the conditional probability distribution solving the master equations. We exemplify both path integrals in analysing elementary chemical reactions. Furthermore, we review a method for the approximation of rare event probabilities and derive path integral representations of Fokker-Planck equations. To make our review accessible to a broad community, we have used the language of probability theory rather than quantum (field) theory. The probabilistic structures underpinning various technical concepts, such as coherent states, the Doi-shift, and normal-ordered observables, are thereby made explicit.},

abstract = {In phenotypically heterogeneous microbial populations, the decision to adopt one or another phenotype is often stochastically regulated. However, how this stochasticity affects interac- tions between competing microbes in mixed communities is difficult to assess. One example of such an interaction system is the competition of an Escherichia coli strain C, which per- forms division of labor between reproducers and self-sacrificing toxin producers, with a toxin-sensitive strain S. The decision between reproduction or toxin production within a single Ccell is inherently stochastic. Here, combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that this stochasticity in the initial phase of colony formation is the crucial determinant for the competition outcome. In the initial phase (t {\textless} 12h), stochasti- city influences the formation of viable Cclusters at the colony edge. In the subsequent phase, the effective fitness differences (set primarily by the degree of division of labor in the C strain population) dictate the deterministic population dynamics and consequently compe- tition outcome. In particular, we observe that competitive success of the Cstrain is only found if (i) aC edge cluster has formed at the end of the initial competition phase and (ii) the beneficial and detrimental effects of toxin production are balanced, which is the case at inter- mediate toxin producer fractions. Our findings highlight the importance of stochastic pro- cesses during the initial phase of colony formation, which might be highly relevant for other microbial community interactions in which the random choice between phenotypes can have long-lasting consequences for community fate.},

abstract = {A diverse array of tumor targeting agents ranging in size from peptides to nanoparticles is currently under development for applications in cancer imaging and therapy. However, it remains largely unclear how size differences among these molecules influence their targeting properties. Here, we develop a simple, mechanistic model that can be used to understand and predict the complex interplay between molecular size, affinity, and tumor uptake. Empirical relationships between molecular radius and capillary permeability, interstitial diffusivity, available volume fraction, and plasma clearance were obtained using data in the literature. These relationships were incorporated into a compartmental model of tumor targeting using MATLAB to predict the magnitude, specificity, time dependence, and affinity dependence of tumor uptake for molecules across a broad size spectrum. In the typical size range for proteins, the model uncovers a complex trend in which intermediate-sized targeting agents (MW, approximately 25 kDa) have the lowest tumor uptake, whereas higher tumor uptake levels are achieved by smaller and larger agents. Small peptides accumulate rapidly in the tumor but require high affinity to be retained, whereas larger proteins can achieve similar retention with {\textgreater}100-fold weaker binding. For molecules in the size range of liposomes, the model predicts that antigen targeting will not significantly increase tumor uptake relative to untargeted molecules. All model predictions are shown to be consistent with experimental observations from published targeting studies. The results and techniques have implications for drug development, imaging, and therapeutic dosing.},

The third-generation sequencing (TGS) technology, led by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), is progressing rapidly, moving from a technology once only capable of providing data for small genome analysis, or for performing targeted screening, to one that promises high quality de novo assembly and structural variation detection for human-sized genomes. In 2014, the MinION, the first commercial sequencer using nanopore technology, was released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). MinION identifies DNA bases by measuring the changes in electrical conductivity generated as DNA strands pass through a biological pore. Its portability, affordability, and speed in data production makes it suitable for real-time applications, the release of the long read sequencer MinION has thus generated much excitement and interest in the genomics community. While de novo genome assemblies can be cheaply produced from SGS data, assembly continuity is often relatively poor, due to the limited ability of short reads to handle long repeats. Assembly quality can be greatly improved by using TGS long reads, since repetitive regions can be easily expanded into using longer sequencing lengths, despite having higher error rates at the base level. The potential of nanopore sequencing has been demonstrated by various studies in genome surveillance at locations where rapid and reliable sequencing is needed, but where resources are limited.},

abstract = {Understanding the nature of interpopulation interactions in host-associated microbial communities is critical to understanding gut colonization, responses to perturbations, and transitions between health and disease. Characterizing these interactions is complicated by the complexity of these communities and the observation that even if populations can be cultured, their in vitro and in vivo phenotypes differ significantly. Dynamic models are the cornerstone of computational systems biology and a key objective of computational systems biologists is the reconstruction of biological networks (i.e., network inference) from high-throughput data. When such computational models reflect biology, they provide an opportunity to generate testable hypotheses as well as to perform experiments that are impractical or not feasible in vivo or in vitro. We modeled time-series data for murine microbial communities using statistical approaches and systems of ordinary differential equations. To obtain the dense time-series data, we sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene from DNA isolated from the fecal material of germfree mice colonized with cecal contents of conventionally raised animals. The modeling results suggested a lack of mutualistic interactions within the community. Among the members of the Bacteroidetes, there was evidence for closely related pairs of populations to exhibit parasitic interactions. Among the Firmicutes, the interactions were all competitive. These results suggest future animal and in silico experiments. Our modeling approach can be applied to other systems to provide a greater understanding of the dynamics of communities associated with health and disease.},

abstract = {Understanding the microbial flora of the cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory tract is of considerable importance, as patient morbidity and death are primarily caused by chronic respiratory infections. However, chronically colonized CF airways represent a surprisingly complex and diverse ecosystem. The precise contributions of different microbes to patient morbidity, and in particular the importance of inter-specific interactions, remain largely unelucidated. The importance of within-species genetic and phenotypic variation has similarly received limited explicit attention. While a host of studies provide data on the microbial species recovered from patients, these are often incomparable due to differences in sampling and data reporting, or do not present the data in a way that aids our understanding of the ecosystem within each patient. This review brings together a cross-section of recent research on the CF airways and the microbes which infect them. The results presented suggest that understanding the CF lung in terms of its community and evolutionary ecology could benefit our understanding of disease progression and influence treatment regimens.},

abstract = {Chronic infections in the respiratory tracts of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are important to investigate, both from medical and from fundamental ecological points of view. Cystic fibrosis respiratory tracts can be described as natural environments harbouring persisting microbial communities with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a dominant pathogen. Various factors contribute to the complexity of this ecosystem, including community composition, dynamics and interactions, as well as heterogeneous distribution and fluctuation of components of the immune system, antibiotics and nutrients. All these elements constitute the selective forces that drive the evolution of the microbes after they migrate from the outer environment to human airways. Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapts to the new environment through genetic changes and exhibits a special lifestyle in chronic CF airways. Understanding the persistent colonization of microbial pathogens in CF patients in the context of ecology and evolution will expand our knowledge of the pathogenesis of chronic infections and improve therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {The structure and dynamics of bacterial communities in the airways of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) remain largely unknown. We characterized the bacterial communities in 126 sputum samples representing serial collections spanning 8-9 y from six age-matched male CF patients. Sputum DNA was analyzed by bar-coded pyrosequencing of the V3-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, defining 662 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from {\textgreater}633,000 sequences. Bacterial community diversity decreased significantly over time in patients with typically progressive lung disease but remained relatively stable in patients with a mild lung disease phenotype. Antibiotic use, rather than patient age or lung function, was the primary driver of decreasing diversity. Interpatient variability in community structure exceeded intrapatient variability in serial samples. Antibiotic treatment was associated with pronounced shifts in community structure, but communities showed both short- and long-term resilience after antibiotic perturbation. There was a positive correlation between OTU occurrence and relative abundance, with a small number of persistent OTUs accounting for the greatest abundance. Significant changes in community structure, diversity, or total bacterial density at the time of pulmonary exacerbation were not observed. Despite decreasing community diversity in patients with progressive disease, total bacterial density remained relatively stable over time. These findings show the critical relationship between airway bacterial community structure, disease stage, and clinical state at the time of sample collection. These features are the key parameters with which to assess the complex ecology of the CF airway.},

Further, airway community dynamics during the days corresponding to the onset of symptoms of respiratory exacerbation have not been studied.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of 95 daily sputum specimens collected from four adults with CF, we observed varying degrees of day-to-day stability in airway bacterial community structures during periods of clinical stability. Differences were observed between study subjects with respect to the degree of community changes at the onset of exacerbation. Decreases in the relative abundance of dominant taxa were observed in three subjects at exacerbation. We observed no relationship between total bacterial load and clinical status and detected no viruses by multiplex PCR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: CF airway microbial communities are relatively stable during periods of clinical stability. Changes in microbial community structure are associated with some, but not all, pulmonary exacerbations, supporting previous observations suggesting that distinct types of exacerbations occur in CF. Decreased abundance of species that are dominant at baseline suggests a role for less abundant taxa in some exacerbations. Daily sampling revealed patterns of change in microbial community structures that may prove useful in the prediction and management of CF pulmonary exacerbations.},

abstract = {While originally characterized as a collection of related syndromes, cystic fibrosis (CF) is now recognized as a single disease whose diverse symptoms stem from the wide tissue distribution of the gene product that is defective in CF, the ion channel and regulator, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Defective CFTR protein impacts the function of the pancreas and alters the consistency of mucosal secretions. The latter of these effects probably plays an important role in the defective resistance of CF patients to many pathogens. As the modalities of CF research have changed over the decades from empirical histological studies to include biophysical measurements of CFTR function, the clinical management of this disease has similarly evolved to effectively address the ever-changing spectrum of CF-related infectious diseases. These factors have led to the successful management of many CF-related infections with the notable exception of chronic lung infection with the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The virulence of P. aeruginosa stems from multiple bacterial attributes, including antibiotic resistance, the ability to utilize quorum-sensing signals to form biofilms, the destructive potential of a multitude of its microbial toxins, and the ability to acquire a mucoid phenotype, which renders this microbe resistant to both the innate and acquired immunologic defenses of the host.},

abstract = {In the context of a polymicrobial infection, treating a specific pathogen poses challenges because of unknown consequences on other members of the community. The presence of ecological interactions between microbes can change their physiology and response to treatment. For example, in the cystic fibrosis lung polymicrobial infection, antimicrobial susceptibility testing on clinical isolates is often not predictive of antibiotic efficacy. Novel approaches are needed to identify the interrelationships within the microbial community to better predict treatment outcomes. Here we used an ecological networking approach on the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics. This analysis showed that the community is separated into three interaction groups: Gram-positive anaerobes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The P. aeruginosa and S. aureus groups both anti-correlate with the anaerobic group, indicating a functional antagonism. When patients are clinically stable, these major groupings were also stable, however, during exacerbation, these communities fragment. Co-occurrence networking of functional modules annotated from metagenomics data supports that the underlying taxonomic structure is driven by differences in the core metabolism of the groups. Topological analysis of the functional network identified the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis as a keystone for the microbial community, which can be targeted with the antibiotic fosmidomycin. This study uses ecological theory to identify novel treatment approaches against a polymicrobial disease with more predictable outcomes. Studying the varying ecology of complex microbial infections in the lungs may help guide treatment options in cystic fibrosis. The disease is complicated due to infection with a diverse community of pathogenic microorganisms. The success of treatments based on identifying and targeting specific microbes can be unpredictable due to the effects of interactions within the mixed microbial ecosystem. Stefanie Widder at the University of Vienna together with Robert Quinn and co-workers in the USA, studied these interactions in six specific cases of cystic fibrosis using lung infection samples gathered over 10 years. They identified three main groups of bacteria involved and developed several hypotheses about inter-relationships that can affect the success of antibiotic treatments. The researchers argue that their new hypotheses and overall ‘ecological theory' will lead to more-reliable predictions of the likely benefits of specific treatment regimes.},

abstract = {Each family of the desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri uses its faeces to build an embankment around its burrow entrance in the form of a ring with an inner radius of 5-10 cm and an outer radius of 8-15 cm. Although the embankment, like the burrow entrance, is detected only by contact with the antennae, it facilitates the return to the burrow after an excursion. When a desert isopod returns from foraging it reaches the burrow entrance itself (diameter 12 mm) only in ca. 12{\%} of the observed cases by "dead reckoning"; the embankment, however, is reached six times more frequently. After detecting this landmark an isopod needs a further 12{\%} of the pathlength of the preceding excursion to locate the burrow entrance. In contrast, it travels five times further to reach its burrow from the same distance (10 cm) if the landmark is missing. The landmark is even more important when the isopod, because of a large error in orientation, can reach its burrow only by searching. Both the characteristics of the search path of H. reaumuri and the success of it's search behaviour correspond well to the respective features of a theoretical procedure, which best solves the search problem of the desert isopods assuming that a landmark is available for orientation. The optimal search procedure was calculated by using information about the probability density that an error in orientation has a given size, and the cumulative probability that the landmark is detected if the isopod searches in it's region with a given intensity. The coupling of the systematic search strategy of H. reaumuri with landmark orientation shortens the average time needed for homing by one-third. It helps an isopod to return to it's burrow after foraging even if all the orientation mechanisms normally used for this task have broken down.},

abstract = {Population structure can dramatically alter mutation load, but the magnitude and direction of this effect depend on whether selection is soft or hard. The abstract nature of previous load models obscured the importance of ecological details in determining the softness of selection. Under the more ecologically explicit model used here, I show that genes related to intrinsic growth rate tend to experience hard selection whereas those genes affecting competitive ability experience softer selection. Although resource limitation determines the strength of selection on competitive ability, it only affects the softness of selection, and thus the load, of mutations with pleiotropic effects on intrinsic growth rate. While competition is typically considered necessary for soft selection, the model shows that interspecific competition hardens selection and can thereby lead to reduced load. Finally, genetic variation in the consumption rates of individuals who die before reproduction can cause supersoft selection, resulting in large increases in load. The same conditions that increase mutation load also increase inbreeding depression.},

abstract = {The genealogical structure of neutral populations in which reproductive success is highly-skewed has been the subject of many recent studies. Here we derive a coalescent dual process for a related class of continuous-time Moran models with viability selection. In these models, individuals can give birth to multiple offspring whose survival depends on both the parental genotype and the brood size. This extends the dual process construction for a multi-type Moran model with genic selection described in Etheridge and Griffiths (2009). We show that in the limit of infinite population size the non-neutral Moran models converge to a Markov jump process which we call the lamda-Fleming-Viot process with viability selection and we derive a coalescent dual for this process directly from the generator and as a limit from the Moran models. The dual is a branching-coalescing process similar to the Ancestral Selection Graph which follows the typed ancestry of genes backwards in time with real and virtual lineages. As an application, the transition functions of the non-neutral Moran and lamda-coalescent models are expressed as mixtures of the transition functions of the dual process.},

abstract = {Classical replicator dynamics assumes that individuals play their games and adopt new strategies on a global level: Each player interacts with a representative sample of the population and if a strategy yields a payoff above the average, then it is expected to spread. In this article, we connect evolutionary models for infinite and finite populations: While the population itself is infinite, interactions and reproduction occurs in random groups of size N. Surprisingly, the resulting dynamics simplifies to the traditional replicator system with a slightly modified payoff matrix. The qualitative results, however, mirror the findings for finite populations, in which strategies are selected according to a probabilistic Moran process. In particular, we derive a one-third law that holds for any population size. In this way, we show that the deterministic replicator equation in an infinite population can be used to study the Moran process in a finite population and vice versa. We apply the results to three examples to shed light on the evolution of cooperation in the iterated prisoner's dilemma, on risk aversion in coordination games and on the maintenance of dominated strategies.},

abstract = {The evolution of drug resistance in HIV occurs by the fixation of specific, well-known, drug-resistance mutations, but the underlying population genetic processes are not well understood. By analyzing within-patient longitudinal sequence data, we make four observations that shed a light on the underlying processes and allow us to infer the short-term effective population size of the viral population in a patient. Our first observation is that the evolution of drug resistance usually occurs by the fixation of one drug-resistance mutation at a time, as opposed to several changes simultaneously. Second, we find that these fixation events are accompanied by a reduction in genetic diversity in the region surrounding the fixed drug-resistance mutation, due to the hitchhiking effect. Third, we observe that the fixation of drug-resistance mutations involves both hard and soft selective sweeps. In a hard sweep, a resistance mutation arises in a single viral particle and drives all linked mutations with it when it spreads in the viral population, which dramatically reduces genetic diversity. On the other hand, in a soft sweep, a resistance mutation occurs multiple times on different genetic backgrounds, and the reduction of diversity is weak. Using the frequency of occurrence of hard and soft sweeps we estimate the effective population size of HIV to be 1.5 x 10(5) (95{\%} confidence interval [0.8 x 10(5),4.8 x 10(5)]). This number is much lower than the actual number of infected cells, but much larger than previous population size estimates based on synonymous diversity. We propose several explanations for the observed discrepancies. Finally, our fourth observation is that genetic diversity at non-synonymous sites recovers to its pre-fixation value within 18 months, whereas diversity at synonymous sites remains depressed after this time period. These results improve our understanding of HIV evolution and have potential implications for treatment strategies.},

abstract = {Why do parasites harm their hosts? The general understanding is that if the transmission rate and virulence of a parasite are linked, then the parasite must harm its host to maximize its transmission. The exact nature of such trade-offs remains largely unclear, but for vertebrate hosts it probably involves interactions between a microparasite and the host immune system. Previous results have suggested that in a homogeneous host population in the absence of super- or coinfection, within-host dynamics lead to selection of the parasite with an intermediate growth rate that is just being controlled by the immune system before it kills the host (Antia et al. 1994). In this paper, we examine how this result changes when heterogeneity is introduced to the host population. We incorporate the simplest form of heterogeneity--random heterogeneity in the parameters describing the size of the initial parasite inoculum, the immune response of the host, and the lethal density at which the parasite kills the host. We find that the general conclusion of the previous model holds: parasites evolve some intermediate growth rate. However, in contrast with the generally accepted view, we find that virulence (measured by the case mortality or the rate of parasite-induced host mortality) increases with heterogeneity. Finally, we link the within-host and between-host dynamics of parasites. We show how the parameters for epidemiological spread of the disease can be estimated from the within-host dynamics, and in doing so examine the way in which trade-offs between these epidemiological parameters arise as a consequence of the interaction of the parasite and the immune response of the host.},

For both autocatalytic and nonautocatalytic reactions, the analysis of the distribution about a stable stationary state and of the transitions between coexisting stable states comes, to logarithmic accuracy, to the analysis of Hamiltonian dynamics of an auxiliary dynamical system. The latter can be done explicitly in a few cases, including one‐species systems, systems with detailed balance, and systems close to the bifurcation points where the number of the stable states changes. In the last case, the fluctuations display universal features, and, for saddle‐node bifurcation points, the logarithm of the probability of escape from the metastable state (per unit time) is proportional to the distance to the bifurcation point (in the parameter space) raised to the power 3/2. We compare the eikonal approximation for the stationary distribution of a master equation to Monte Carlo numerical solutions for two chemical two‐variable systems with multiple stationary states, where none of the cited restrictions exists.

abstract = {We investigate how a catastrophic event (modeled as a temporary fall of the reproduction rate) increases the extinction probability of an isolated self-regulated stochastic population. Using a variant of the Verhulst logistic model as an example, we combine the probability generating function technique with an eikonal approximation to evaluate the exponentially large increase in the extinction probability caused by the catastrophe. This quantity is given by the eikonal action computed over “the optimal path” (instanton) of an effective classical Hamiltonian system with a time-dependent Hamiltonian. For a general catastrophe the eikonal equations can be solved numerically. For simple models of catastrophic events analytic solutions can be obtained. One such solution becomes quite simple close to the bifurcation point of the Verhulst model. The eikonal results for the increase in the extinction probability caused by a catastrophe agree well with numerical solutions of the master equation.},

abstract = {Often sharp changes in cellular behavior are triggered by thresholded events, i.e., by the attainment of a threshold value of a relevant cellular or molecular dynamical variable. Since the governing variable itself typically undergoes noisy or stochastic dynamics, there is a corresponding variability in the times when the same change occurs in each cell of a population. This time is called the "first passage" time and the corresponding process is a "first passage" (FP) process, referring to the event when a random variable first passes the threshold value. In this review we first present and elucidate fundamentals of the FP formalism within a unified conceptual framework, which naturally integrates the existing techniques. We then discuss applications thereof, with emphasis on the practical use of FP techniques in biophysical systems. Our focus here is on covering a diverse set of analytical techniques; the number of reviewed biological applications is thus limited, out of necessity. We focus on three specific areas: channel transport; receptor binding and adhesion; and single-cell growth and division.},

abstract = {Stochasticity can play an important role in the dynamics of biologically relevant populations. These span a broad range of scales: from intra-cellular populations of molecules to population of cells and then to groups of plants, animals and people. Large deviations in stochastic population dynamics - such as those determining population extinction, fixation or switching between different states - are presently in a focus of attention of statistical physicists. We review recent progress in applying different variants of dissipative WKB approximation (after Wentzel, Kramers and Brillouin) to this class of problems. The WKB approximation allows one to evaluate the mean time and/or probability of population extinction, fixation and switches resulting from either intrinsic (demographic) noise, or a combination of the demographic noise and environmental variations, deterministic or random. We mostly cover well-mixed populations, single and multiple, but also briefly consider populations on heterogeneous networks and spatial populations. The spatial setting also allows one to study large fluctuations of the speed of biological invasions. Finally, we briefly discuss possible directions of future work.},

@article{Marino2014,
abstract = {In the context of a polymicrobial infection, treating a specific pathogen poses challenges because of unknown consequences on other members of the community. The presence of ecological interactions between microbes can change their physiology and response to treatment. For example, in the cystic fibrosis lung polymicrobial infection, antimicrobial susceptibility testing on clinical isolates is often not predictive of antibiotic efficacy. Novel approaches are needed to identify the interrelationships within the microbial community to better predict treatment outcomes. Here we used an ecological networking approach on the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics. This analysis showed that the community is separated into three interaction groups: Gram-positive anaerobes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The P. aeruginosa and S. aureus groups both anti-correlate with the anaerobic group, indicating a functional antagonism. When patients are clinically stable, these major groupings were also stable, however, during exacerbation, these communities fragment. Co-occurrence networking of functional modules annotated from metagenomics data supports that the underlying taxonomic structure is driven by differences in the core metabolism of the groups. Topological analysis of the functional network identified the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis as a keystone for the microbial community, which can be targeted with the antibiotic fosmidomycin. This study uses ecological theory to identify novel treatment approaches against a polymicrobial disease with more predictable outcomes. Studying the varying ecology of complex microbial infections in the lungs may help guide treatment options in cystic fibrosis. The disease is complicated due to infection with a diverse community of pathogenic microorganisms. The success of treatments based on identifying and targeting specific microbes can be unpredictable due to the effects of interactions within the mixed microbial ecosystem. Stefanie Widder at the University of Vienna together with Robert Quinn and co-workers in the USA, studied these interactions in six specific cases of cystic fibrosis using lung infection samples gathered over 10 years. They identified three main groups of bacteria involved and developed several hypotheses about inter-relationships that can affect the success of antibiotic treatments. The researchers argue that their new hypotheses and overall ‘ecological theory' will lead to more-reliable predictions of the likely benefits of specific treatment regimes.},

abstract = {We investigate the phenomenon of extinction of a long-lived self-regulating stochastic population, caused by intrinsic (demographic) noise. Extinction typically occurs via one of two scenarios depending on whether the absorbing state n=0 is a repelling (scenario A) or attracting (scenario B) point of the deterministic rate equation. In scenario A the metastable stochastic population resides in the vicinity of an attracting fixed point next to the repelling point n=0 . In scenario B there is an intermediate repelling point n=n1 between the attracting point n=0 and another attracting point n=n2 in the vicinity of which the metastable population resides. The crux of the theory is a dissipative variant of WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation which assumes that the typical population size in the metastable state is large. Starting from the master equation, we calculate the quasistationary probability distribution of the population sizes and the (exponentially long) mean time to extinction for each of the two scenarios. When necessary, the WKB approximation is complemented (i) by a recursive solution of the quasistationary master equation at small n and (ii) by the van Kampen system-size expansion, valid near the fixed points of the deterministic rate equation. The theory yields both entropic barriers to extinction and pre-exponential factors, and holds for a general set of multistep processes when detailed balance is broken. The results simplify considerably for single-step processes and near the characteristic bifurcations of scenarios A and B.},

abstract = {Theoretical ecologists have long sought to understand how the persistence of populations depends on biotic and abiotic factors. Classical work showed that demographic stochasticity causes the mean time to extinction to increase exponentially with population size, whereas variation in environmental conditions can lead to a power-law scaling. Recent work has focused especially on the influence of the autocorrelation structure ('color') of environmental noise. In theoretical physics, there is a burst of research activity in analyzing large fluctuations in stochastic population dynamics. This research provides powerful tools for determining extinction times and characterizing the pathway to extinction. It yields, therefore, sharp insights into extinction processes and has great potential for further applications in theoretical biology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

While the deterministic approach (rate equations) predicts the coexistence of the species resulting in regular (yet neutrally stable) oscillations of the population densities, we demonstrate that fluctuations arising in the system with a $\backslash$emph{\{}finite number of agents{\}} drastically alter this picture and are responsible for extinction: After long enough time, two of the three species die out. As main findings we provide analytic estimates and numerical computation of the extinction probability at a given time.

abstract = {The developmental dynamics of multicellular organisms is a process that takes place in a multi-stable system in which each attractor state represents a cell type, and attractor transitions correspond to cell differentiation paths. This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the 'relative stabilities' of N attractors (N {\textgreater}2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.},

We consider how this new perspective in cystic fibrosis (CF) may affect treatment choices.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Standard clinical microbiology of CF infection exacerbations often fails to provide indications of microbial causes that may drive the onset of exacerbation and the anticipated bacteriologic responses to the usual parenteral antibiotics prescribed as treatment. Antimicrobial responses by nonclassical members of the CF airway microbiome may explain why most patients clinically improve. These other organisms contribute to disease either directly as pathogens missed by conventional microbiology or through synergy with conventional pathogens. With these considerations, therapy may best be guided by directed antibiotic therapy to numerically significant isolates. An example is the Streptococcus milleri group, which we now believe to represent new pathogens that profile the exacerbations of infection in the CF lung and that necessitate specific antibiotic therapy to prevent loss of lung function and reduce frequency of exacerbations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: A comprehensive understanding of airway infections offers the potential for improved disease management in CF patients. Accurate quantitative microbiology will be a prerequisite for routine intervention based on the polymicrobial perspective of CF infection exacerbations.},

abstract = {The extinction of a single species due to demographic stochasticity is analyzed. The discrete nature of the individual agents and the Poissonian noise related to the birth-death processes result in local extinction of a metastable population, as the system hits the absorbing state. The Fokker-Planck formulation of that problem fails to capture the statistics of large deviations from the metastable state, while approximations appropriate close to the absorbing state become, in general, invalid as the population becomes large. To connect these two regimes, a master equation based on a real space WKB method is presented, and is shown to yield an excellent approximation for the decay rate and the extreme events statistics all the way down to the absorbing state. The details of the underlying microscopic process, smeared out in a mean field treatment, are shown to be crucial for an exact determination of the extinction exponent. This general scheme is shown to reproduce the known results in the field, to yield new corollaries and to fit quite precisely the numerical solutions. Moreover it allows for systematic improvement via a series expansion where the small parameter is the inverse of the number of individuals in the metastable state.},

abstract = {Populations of competing biological species exhibit a fascinating interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of evolutionary selection forces and random fluctuations arising from the stochastic nature of the interactions. The processes leading to extinction of species, whose understanding is a key component in the study of evolution and biodiversity, are influenced by both of these factors. In this paper, we investigate a class of stochastic population dynamics models based on generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. In the case of neutral stability of the underlying deterministic model, the impact of intrinsic noise on the survival of species is dramatic: it destroys coexistence of interacting species on a time scale proportional to the population size. We introduce a new method based on stochastic averaging which allows one to understand this extinction process quantitatively by reduction to a lower-dimensional effective dynamics. This is performed analytically for two highly symmetrical models and can be generalized numerically to more complex situations. The extinction probability distributions and other quantities of interest we obtain show excellent agreement with simulations.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a mathematical model in which any number of competing species can coexist on four resources which regenerate according to an algebraic relationship. We show that previous attempts to prove that n species cannot coexist on fewer that n resources (the "competitive exclusion principle") all make use of the very restrictive assumption that the specific growth rates of all competing species are linear functions of resource densities. When this restriction is relaxed, it becomes possible to find situations in which n species can coexist on fewer than n resources. On the basis of this and other observations we conclude that the competitive exclusion principle should be considered to apply only to coexistence at fixed densities. ?? 1976.},
annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Coexistence of species competing for shared resources - Armstrong, Robert A.; McGehee, Richard)

The linearity restriction on competitor growth rates (that the specific growth rate of each competitor is a linear function of resource density) is by itself of critical importance to any proof of the competitive exclusion principIe.

If growth rates are not linear in the ressources, n species can coexist indefinitely on four resources. (periodic moments it would seem)

abstract = {Microbes typically form diverse communities of interacting species, whose activities have tremendous impact on the plants, animals, and humans they associate with, as well as on the biogeochemistry of the entire planet. The ability to predict the structure of these complex communities is crucial to understanding, managing, and utilizing them. Here, we propose a simple, qualitative assembly rule that predicts community structure from the outcomes of competitions between small sets of species, and experimentally assess its predictive power using synthetic microbial communities. The rule's accuracy was evaluated by competing combinations of up to eight soil bacterial species, and comparing the experimentally observed outcomes to the predicted ones. Nearly all competitions resulted in a unique, stable community, whose composition was independent of the initial species fractions. Survival in three-species competitions was predicted by the pairwise outcomes with an accuracy of {\~{}}90{\%}. Obtaining a similar level of accuracy in competitions between sets of seven or all eight species required incorporating additional information regarding the outcomes of the three-species competitions. Our results demonstrate experimentally the ability of a simple bottom-up approach to predict community structure. Such an approach is key for anticipating the response of communities to changing environments, designing interventions to steer existing communities to more desirable states, and, ultimately, rationally designing communities de novo.},

Although a lot of experimental studies have been reported in this direction, a comprehensive picture is still missing, in particular due to the multitude of different scenarios under which experiments have been performed. In this review an analysis of existing experimental data about the protein corona, and an outline for required future work will be given. In particular we review how existing simple analytical models such as the adopted Hill model may help to extract quantitative data from such experiments such as equilibrium dissociation and kinetic coefficients. Careful quantitative assessment of equilibrium and kinetic properties would allow for a comparison of protein binding data from the vast array of engineered nanoparticles, so that basic principles could be revealed.

abstract = {Momentum-space representation provides an interesting perspective on the theory of large fluctuations in populations undergoing Markovian stochastic gain–loss processes. This representation is obtained when the master equation for the probability distribution of the population size is transformed into an evolution equation for the probability generating function. Spectral decomposition then yields an eigenvalue problem for a non-Hermitian linear differential operator. The ground-state eigenmode encodes the stationary distribution of the population size. For long-lived metastable populations which exhibit extinction or escape to another metastable state, the quasi-stationary distribution and the mean time to extinction or escape are encoded by the eigenmode and eigenvalue of the lowest excited state. If the average population size in the stationary or quasi-stationary state is large, the corresponding eigenvalue problem can be solved via the WKB approximation amended by other asymptotic methods. We illustrate these ideas in several model examples.},

Some diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, have exactly this sort of community etiology. Mathematical network theory is ideal for studying the ecological networks of interacting species that comprise the human microbiome. Theoretical networks require little consortia specific data to provide insight into both normal and disturbed microbial community functions, but it is easy to incorporate additional empirical data as it becomes available.

abstract = {Understanding the role of serum protein in the process of nanoparticle delivery is of great importance in biomedicine. Here, by using dissipative particle dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the interactions between the nanoparticle-protein corona complex and cell membranes of different types. It is found that the human serum albumin (HSA) will just adsorb onto charged (especially for positively charged) and hydrophobic nanoparticle surface. More importantly, we also provide specific insights into the effect of HSA adsorption on the in vivo transportation of nanoparticle (i.e., immune response and targeted cellular uptake). Our results show that the protein corona can change the interaction modes of hydrophobic nanoparticles and enhance the interaction of charged nanoparticles with macrophage cell membranes, while it may also cause the failure of insertion of hydrophobic nanoparticles and the loss of targeting specificity of charged nanoparticles with cancer cell membranes. These results can help better understand the biological significance of protein corona and may give some useful suggestions on better design of future nanoparticles in drug delivery. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Results are summarized from the literature on three commonly used stochastic population models with regard to persistence time. In addition, several new results are introduced to clearly illustrate similarities between the models. Specifically, the relations between the mean persistence time and higher-order moments for discrete-time Markov chain models, continuous-time Markov chain models, and stochastic differential equation models are compared for populations experiencing demographic variability. Similarities between the models are demonstrated analytically, and computational results are provided to show that estimated persistence times for the three stochastic models are generally in good agreement when the models are consistently formulated. As an example, the three stochastic models are applied to a population satisfying logistic growth. Logistic growth is interesting as different birth and death rates can yield the same logistic differential equation. However, the persistence behavior of the population is strongly dependent on the explicit forms for the birth and death rates. Computational results demonstrate how dramatically the mean persistence time can vary for different populations that experience the same logistic growth. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The role of mutations in evolution depends upon the distribution of their effects on fitness. This distribution is likely to depend on the environment. Indeed genotype-by-environment interactions are key for the process of local adaptation and ecological specialization. An important trait in bacterial evolution is antibiotic resistance, which presents a clear case of change in the direction of selection between environments with and without antibiotics. Here, we study the distribution of fitness effects of mutations, conferring antibiotic resistance to Escherichia coli, in benign and stressful environments without drugs. We interpret the distributions in the light of a fitness landscape model that assumes a single fitness peak. We find that mutation effects (s) are well described by a shifted gamma distribution, with a shift parameter that reflects the distance to the fitness peak and varies across environments. Consistent with the theoretical predictions of Fisher's geometrical model, with a Gaussian relationship between phenotype and fitness, we find that the main effect of stress is to increase the variance in s. Our findings are in agreement with the results of a recent meta-analysis, which suggest that a simple fitness landscape model may capture the variation of mutation effects across species and environments.},

Assessments of extinction risk often lack effects of interspecific interactions. We study a birth and death process in which the death rate includes an effect of predation. Predation is included via a general nonlinear expression for the functional response of predation to prey density. We investigate the effects of the foraging parameters (e.g. attack rate and handling time) on the mean time to extinction. Mean time to extinction varies by orders of magnitude when we alter the foraging parameters, even when we exclude the effects of these parameters on the equilibrium population size. Conclusions are robust to assumptions about initial conditions and variable predator abundance. These findings clearly show that accounting for the nature of interspecific interactions is likely to be critically important when estimating extinction risk. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Extinction risk in natural populations depends on stochastic factors that affect individuals, and is estimated by incorporating such factors into stochastic models. Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals (demographic stochasticity), variation in population-level birth and death rates among times or locations (environmental stochasticity), the sex of individuals and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population (demographic heterogeneity). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews stochastic models of extinction within a local population. The main thread of the chapter is an analytic model of environmental stochasticity, in which populations fluctuate between a ceiling and extinction. A diffusion analysis of environmental and demographic stochasticity is complemented by analytic and numerical investigations into the robustness of the analysis. The environmental stochasticity model presented in this chapter generates simple analytic predictions of extinction rates and population densities. These can be used in metapopulation models to improve analysis of the fundamental processes of extinction and colonization. The environmental stochasticity model has many largely unexplored implications for metapopulation dynamics. Emigration rates are influenced by local fluctuations; extinction rates become correlated across populations; and the time scales of local growth and extinction may overlap. Simulations in discrete time, used in the study, show that the diffusion analysis works. The robustness investigations show that the model can be extended to deal with many biological details.},

abstract = {Summary The concepts of metapopulation dynamics and metapopulation persistence in fragmented landscapes have become well established in ecology during the past 5 years(Hastings and Harrison, 1994; May, 1994; Harrison, 1994b; Hanski, 1994b; Kareiva and Wennergren, 1995). The accelerating loss and fragmentation of natural habitats (Morris, 1995), of which most of us are personally and painfully aware, makes it tempting to suggest that, in an increasing number of species, the spatial structure of populations is somehow consequential to their dynamics. Many studies have demonstrated that small populations in small habitat fragments have a high risk of extinction(Schoener and Spiller, 1987b; Kindvall and Ahlen, 1992; Hanski, 1994b); hence if only small fragments remain, long-term persstence becomes necessarily a regional issue. We have now an extensive theoretical literature on metapopulation dynamics(Hanski, 1985, 1994a,b; Gilpin and Hanski, 1991; Hastings, 1991; gyllenberg and Hanski, 1992; Hanski and Gyllenberg, 1993; Hastings and Higgins, 1994; Tilman et al., 1994; Hassell et al., 1994; Durrett and Levin, 1994; Hastings and Harrison, 1994) and a large number of useful empirical studies (Harrison et al., 1988; McCauley, 1989; Nachman, 1991; Harrison, 1991; Sjogren, 1991; Sjogren Gulve, 1994; Whitlock, 1992b; Thomas and Harrison, 1992; Bengtsson, 1993; Hanski et al., 1994, 1995a; many chapters in this volume). Nonetheless it is fair to say that our understanding of metapopulation dynamics in real fragmented landscapes is still restricted (Harrison and Taylor, this volume), largely because of the practical problems of conducting sound empirical research at a sufficiently large spatial scale.},

The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, and generalization before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton-proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists maybe able to contribute.

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

abstract = {Cells need to reliably sense external ligand concentrations to achieve various biological functions such as chemotaxis or signaling. The molecular recognition of ligands by surface receptors is degenerate in many systems leading to crosstalk between different receptors. Crosstalk is often thought of as a deviation from optimal specific recognition, as the binding of non-cognate ligands can interfere with the detection of the receptor's cognate ligand, possibly leading to a false triggering of a downstream signaling pathway. Here we quantify the optimal precision of sensing the concentrations of multiple ligands by a collection of promiscuous receptors. We demonstrate that crosstalk can improve precision in concentration sensing and discrimination tasks. To achieve superior precision, the additional information about ligand concentrations contained in short binding events of the non-cognate ligand should be exploited. We present a proofreading scheme to realize an approximate estimation of multiple ligand concentrations that reaches a precision close to the derived optimal bounds. Our results help rationalize the observed ubiquity of receptor crosstalk in molecular sensing.},

abstract = {Microbes assemble into complex, dynamic, and species-rich communities that play critical roles in human health and in the environment. The complexity of natural environments and the large number of niches present in most habitats are often invoked to explain the maintenance of microbial diversity in the presence of competitive exclusion. Here we show that soil and plant-associated microbiota, cultivated ex situ in minimal synthetic environments with a single supplied source of carbon, universally re-assemble into large and dynamically stable communities with strikingly predictable coarse-grained taxonomic and functional compositions. We find that generic, non-specific metabolic cross-feeding leads to the assembly of dense facilitation networks that enable the coexistence of multiple competitors for the supplied carbon source. The inclusion of universal and non-specific cross-feeding in ecological consumer-resource models is sufficient to explain our observations, and predicts a simple determinism in community structure, a property reflected in our experiments.},

We next provide a critical overview of mathematical approaches, ranging from phenomenological to mechanistic, to decipher the principles that govern the function, dynamics and evolution of microbial ecosystems. Finally, we present our outlook on key aspects of microbial ecosystems and synthetic ecology that require further developments, including the need for more efficient computational algorithms, a better integration of empirical methods and model-driven analysis, the importance of improving gene function annotation, and the value of a standardized library of well-characterized organisms to be used as building blocks of synthetic communities.},

abstract = {Spatially extended population dynamics models that incorporate intrinsic noise serve as case studies for the role of fluctuations and correlations in biological systems. Including spatial structure and stochastic noise in predator-prey competition invalidates the deterministic Lotka-Volterra picture of neutral population cycles. Stochastic models yield long-lived erratic population oscillations stemming from a resonant amplification mechanism. In spatially extended predator-prey systems, one observes noise-stabilized activity and persistent correlations. Fluctuation-induced renormalizations of the oscillation parameters can be analyzed perturbatively. The critical dynamics and the non-equilibrium relaxation kinetics at the predator extinction threshold are characterized by the directed percolation universality class. Spatial or environmental variability results in more localized patches which enhances both species densities. Affixing variable rates to individual particles and allowing for trait inheritance subject to mutations induces fast evolutionary dynamics for the rate distributions. Stochastic spatial variants of cyclic competition with rock-paper-scissors interactions illustrate connections between population dynamics and evolutionary game theory, and demonstrate how space can help maintain diversity. In two dimensions, three-species cyclic competition models of the May-Leonard type are characterized by the emergence of spiral patterns whose properties are elucidated by a mapping onto a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Extensions to general food networks can be classified on the mean-field level, which provides both a fundamental understanding of ensuing cooperativity and emergence of alliances. Novel space-time patterns emerge as a result of the formation of competing alliances, such as coarsening domains that each incorporate rock-paper-scissors competition games.},

This development has opened the way to apply mathematical models to characterize community structure and dynamics, to predict responses to perturbations and to explore general dynamical properties such as stability, alternative stable states and periodicity. Here, we highlight the role of dynamical systems theory in the exploration of microbial communities, with a special emphasis on the generalized Lotka–Volterra (gLV) equations. In particular, we discuss applications, assumptions and limitations of the gLV model, mention modifications to address these limitations and review stochastic extensions.

abstract = {The scientific community has recognized that almost 99{\%} of the microbial life on earth is represented by biofilms. Considering the impacts of their sessile lifestyle on both natural and human activities, extensive experimental activity has been carried out to understand how biofilms grow and interact with the environment. Many mathematical models have also been developed to simulate and elucidate the main processes characterizing the biofilm growth. Two main mathematical approaches for biomass representation can be distinguished: continuum and discrete. This review is aimed at exploring the main characteristics of each approach. Continuum models can simulate the biofilm processes in a quantitative and deterministic way. However, they require a multidimensional formulation to take into account the biofilm spatial heterogeneity, which makes the models quite complicated, requiring significant computational effort. Discrete models are more recent and can represent the typical multidimensional structural heterogeneity of biofilm reflecting the experimental expectations, but they generate computational results including elements of randomness and introduce stochastic effects into the solutions.},
